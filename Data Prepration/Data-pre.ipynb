That includes products like its bandages, skin adhesives, oral aligners, air purifiers and optical lenses.\n\nThe company's health-care products also include the Bair Hugger surgical warming system, which is currently the subject of nearly 6,000 lawsuits. 3M maintains that the product has no relation to surgical-site infections.\n\n3M health-care products recorded more than $8 billion in sales in 2021. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of next year, and 3M will maintain a 19.9% stake in the new company.\n\nThe announcement comes as 3M said its second-quarter revenue fell nearly 3% to $8.7 billion. Net income dropped to $78 million from $1.5 billion a year earlier, including a $1.2 billion pretax charge tied to resolving litigation related to Combat Arms Earplugs.\n\nThe company said Aearo Technologies, its subsidiary that produces Combat Arms Earplugs, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings to establish a trust to resolve all legal claims related to the product. 3M said it believe the earplugs were safe and effective when used properly, but that they nevertheless face increasing litigation.\n\nAfter excluding that one-time charge, 3M earned $2.48 per share. The performance topped expectations. According to Refinitv, analysts expected 3M to earn $2.42 per share on revenue of $8.58 billion.\n\nShares of the company closed up 5% at $140.82.\n\n3M is also simultaneously spinning off its food safety business.

         "3M must face more than 230,000 lawsuits accusing it of selling defective earplugs to the U.S. military, after a U.S. judge on Friday ruled that the bankruptcy of a subsidiary did not stop lawsuits against the non-bankrupt parent company.\n\nCompanies that file for bankruptcy typically receive an immediate reprieve from lawsuits, and 3M subsidiary Aearo Technologies LLC argued that extending those protections to 3M would buy Aearo time to address its debts and restructuring goals.\n\nAearo and 3M had argued that bankruptcy offered a faster and fairer way to compensate veterans who say that earplugs made by Aearo caused hearing loss.\n\nBut bankruptcy Judge Jeffrey J. Graham in Indianapolis said that Aearo's bankruptcy restructuring could proceed in parallel with the lawsuits.\n\nWhile the \"sheer size\" of the consolidated litigation may have spurred 3M and Aearo to seek \"additional leverage\" through the bankruptcy proceedings, that did not create a legal need to protect 3M, Graham ruled.\n\nAttorneys representing the veterans with hearing loss said they looked forward to continuing their lawsuits against 3M in other courts.\n\n\"Judge Graham's decision is a complete rejection of 3M's attempt to evade accountability and hide in bankruptcy after multiple juries found it liable for knowingly causing hearing damage to those who served our nation,\" plaintiff attorneys Bryan Aylstock and Christopher Seeger said in a statement.\n\nA spokesman for 3M said it intended to appeal. 3M has set aside $1 billion to settle the earplug litigation.\n\n\"Continuing to litigate these cases one-by-one over the coming years will not provide certainty or fairness for any party,\" 3M spokesman Sean Lynch said.\n\n3M subsidiary Aearo Technologies LLC filed for bankruptcy protection in Indiana on July 26, seeking to resolve lawsuits alleging that 3M's Combat Arms Earplugs Version 2 (CAEv2) caused hearing loss.\n\nThe lawsuits have been consolidated in federal court in Florida and have grown into the largest mass tort litigation in U.S. history. Aearo placed $1 billion in a trust to settle them and agreed to indemnify 3M for all liability related to CAEv2.\n\n3M has denied liability, saying its earplugs offered protection to soldiers while allowing them to hear on the battlefield.\n\n",

         "3M announced Tuesday it will spin off its health-care business into a separate publicly traded company.\n\nThe new business will focus on wound and oral care, health-care IT and biopharma filtration, the material science company said in a release. That includes products like its bandages, skin adhesives, oral aligners, air purifiers and optical lenses.\n\nThe company's health-care products also include the Bair Hugger surgical warming system, which is currently the subject of nearly 6,000 lawsuits. 3M maintains that the product has no relation to surgical-site infections.\n\n3M health-care products recorded more than $8 billion in sales in 2021. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of next year, and 3M will maintain a 19.9% stake in the new company.\n\nThe announcement comes as 3M said its second-quarter revenue fell nearly 3% to $8.7 billion. Net income dropped to $78 million from $1.5 billion a year earlier, including a $1.2 billion pretax charge tied to resolving litigation related to Combat Arms Earplugs.\n\nThe company said Aearo Technologies, its subsidiary that produces Combat Arms Earplugs, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings to establish a trust to resolve all legal claims related to the product. 3M said it believe the earplugs were safe and effective when used properly, but that they nevertheless face increasing litigation.\n\nAfter excluding that one-time charge, 3M earned $2.48 per share. The performance topped expectations. According to Refinitv, analysts expected 3M to earn $2.42 per share on revenue of $8.58 billion.\n\nShares of the company closed up 5% at $140.82.\n\n3M is also simultaneously spinning off its food safety business. That branch will merge with Neogen and is expected to be divested by September.\n\n— Reuters contributed to this report.",

         "3M must face more than 230,000 lawsuits accusing it of selling defective earplugs to the U.S. military, after a U.S. judge on Friday ruled that the bankruptcy of a subsidiary did not stop lawsuits against the non-bankrupt parent company.\n\nCompanies that file for bankruptcy typically receive an immediate reprieve from lawsuits, and 3M subsidiary Aearo Technologies LLC argued that extending those protections to 3M would buy Aearo time to address its debts and restructuring goals.\n\nAearo and 3M had argued that bankruptcy offered a faster and fairer way to compensate veterans who say that earplugs made by Aearo caused hearing loss.\n\nBut bankruptcy Judge Jeffrey J. Graham in Indianapolis said that Aearo's bankruptcy restructuring could proceed in parallel with the lawsuits.\n\nWhile the \"sheer size\" of the consolidated litigation may have spurred 3M and Aearo to seek \"additional leverage\" through the bankruptcy proceedings, that did not create a legal need to protect 3M, Graham ruled.\n\nAttorneys representing the veterans with hearing loss said they looked forward to continuing their lawsuits against 3M in other courts.\n\n\"Judge Graham's decision is a complete rejection of 3M's attempt to evade accountability and hide in bankruptcy after multiple juries found it liable for knowingly causing hearing damage to those who served our nation,\" plaintiff attorneys Bryan Aylstock and Christopher Seeger said in a statement.\n\nA spokesman for 3M said it intended to appeal. 3M has set aside $1 billion to settle the earplug litigation.\n\n\"Continuing to litigate these cases one-by-one over the coming years will not provide certainty or fairness for any party,\" 3M spokesman Sean Lynch said.\n\n3M subsidiary Aearo Technologies LLC filed for bankruptcy protection in Indiana on July 26, seeking to resolve lawsuits alleging that 3M's Combat Arms Earplugs Version 2 (CAEv2) caused hearing loss.\n\nThe lawsuits have been consolidated in federal court in Florida and have grown into the largest mass tort litigation in U.S. history. Aearo placed $1 billion in a trust to settle them and agreed to indemnify 3M for all liability related to CAEv2.\n\n3M has denied liability, saying its earplugs offered protection to soldiers while allowing them to hear on the battlefield.\n\n",

         "3M announced Tuesday it will spin off its health-care business into a separate publicly traded company.\n\nThe new business will focus on wound and oral care, health-care IT and biopharma filtration, the material science company said in a release. That includes products like its bandages, skin adhesives, oral aligners, air purifiers and optical lenses.\n\nThe company's health-care products also include the Bair Hugger surgical warming system, which is currently the subject of nearly 6,000 lawsuits. 3M maintains that the product has no relation to surgical-site infections.\n\n3M health-care products recorded more than $8 billion in sales in 2021. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of next year, and 3M will maintain a 19.9% stake in the new company.\n\nThe announcement comes as 3M said its second-quarter revenue fell nearly 3% to $8.7 billion. Net income dropped to $78 million from $1.5 billion a year earlier, including a $1.2 billion pretax charge tied to resolving litigation related to Combat Arms Earplugs.\n\nThe company said Aearo Technologies, its subsidiary that produces Combat Arms Earplugs, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings to establish a trust to resolve all legal claims related to the product. 3M said it believe the earplugs were safe and effective when used properly, but that they nevertheless face increasing litigation.\n\nAfter excluding that one-time charge, 3M earned $2.48 per share. The performance topped expectations. According to Refinitv, analysts expected 3M to earn $2.42 per share on revenue of $8.58 billion.\n\nShares of the company closed up 5% at $140.82.\n\n3M is also simultaneously spinning off its food safety business.

An increasing number of e-commerce deliveries have boosted demand for trucks. The company beat analysts' expectations for per-share earnings, according to StreetAccount.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices — Shares slid 2.4% after Bernstein downgraded the semiconductor maker to market perform from outperform.

         "3M must face more than 230,000 lawsuits accusing it of selling defective earplugs to the U.S. military, after a U.S. judge on Friday ruled that the bankruptcy of a subsidiary did not stop lawsuits against the non-bankrupt parent company.\n\nCompanies that file for bankruptcy typically receive an immediate reprieve from lawsuits, and 3M subsidiary Aearo Technologies LLC argued that extending those protections to 3M would buy Aearo time to address its debts and restructuring goals.\n\nAearo and 3M had argued that bankruptcy offered a faster and fairer way to compensate veterans who say that earplugs made by Aearo caused hearing loss.\n\nBut bankruptcy Judge Jeffrey J. Graham in Indianapolis said that Aearo's bankruptcy restructuring could proceed in parallel with the lawsuits.\n\nWhile the \"sheer size\" of the consolidated litigation may have spurred 3M and Aearo to seek \"additional leverage\" through the bankruptcy proceedings, that did not create a legal need to protect 3M, Graham ruled.\n\nAttorneys representing the veterans with hearing loss said they looked forward to continuing their lawsuits against 3M in other courts.\n\n\"Judge Graham's decision is a complete rejection of 3M's attempt to evade accountability and hide in bankruptcy after multiple juries found it liable for knowingly causing hearing damage to those who served our nation,\" plaintiff attorneys Bryan Aylstock and Christopher Seeger said in a statement.\n\nA spokesman for 3M said it intended to appeal. 3M has set aside $1 billion to settle the earplug litigation.\n\n\"Continuing to litigate these cases one-by-one over the coming years will not provide certainty or fairness for any party,\" 3M spokesman Sean Lynch said.\n\n3M subsidiary Aearo Technologies LLC filed for bankruptcy protection in Indiana on July 26, seeking to resolve lawsuits alleging that 3M's Combat Arms Earplugs Version 2 (CAEv2) caused hearing loss.\n\nThe lawsuits have been consolidated in federal court in Florida and have grown into the largest mass tort litigation in U.S. history. Aearo placed $1 billion in a trust to settle them and agreed to indemnify 3M for all liability related to CAEv2.\n\n3M has denied liability, saying its earplugs offered protection to soldiers while allowing them to hear on the battlefield.\n\n",

         "3M announced Tuesday it will spin off its health-care business into a separate publicly traded company.\n\nThe new business will focus on wound and oral care, health-care IT and biopharma filtration, the material science company said in a release. That includes products like its bandages, skin adhesives, oral aligners, air purifiers and optical lenses.\n\nThe company's health-care products also include the Bair Hugger surgical warming system, which is currently the subject of nearly 6,000 lawsuits. 3M maintains that the product has no relation to surgical-site infections.\n\n3M health-care products recorded more than $8 billion in sales in 2021. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of next year, and 3M will maintain a 19.9% stake in the new company.\n\nThe announcement comes as 3M said its second-quarter revenue fell nearly 3% to $8.7 billion. Net income dropped to $78 million from $1.5 billion a year earlier, including a $1.2 billion pretax charge tied to resolving litigation related to Combat Arms Earplugs.\n\nThe company said Aearo Technologies, its subsidiary that produces Combat Arms Earplugs, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings to establish a trust to resolve all legal claims related to the product. 3M said it believe the earplugs were safe and effective when used properly, but that they nevertheless face increasing litigation.\n\nAfter excluding that one-time charge, 3M earned $2.48 per share. The performance topped expectations. According to Refinitv, analysts expected 3M to earn $2.42 per share on revenue of $8.58 billion.\n\nShares of the company closed up 5% at $140.82.\n\n3M is also simultaneously spinning off its food safety business. That branch will merge with Neogen and is expected to be divested by September.\n\n— Reuters contributed to this report.",

         "3M combat earplug lawsuits to proceed, judge rules, despite bankruptcy case",
         "3M must face more than 230,000 lawsuits accusing it of selling defective earplugs to the U.S. military, after a U.S. judge on Friday ruled that the bankruptcy of a subsidiary did not stop lawsuits against the non-bankrupt parent company.\n\nCompanies that file for bankruptcy typically receive an immediate reprieve from lawsuits, and 3M subsidiary Aearo Technologies LLC argued that extending those protections to 3M would buy Aearo time to address its debts and restructuring goals.\n\nAearo and 3M had argued that bankruptcy offered a faster and fairer way to compensate veterans who say that earplugs made by Aearo caused hearing loss.\n\nBut bankruptcy Judge Jeffrey J. Graham in Indianapolis said that Aearo's bankruptcy restructuring could proceed in parallel with the lawsuits.\n\nWhile the \"sheer size\" of the consolidated litigation may have spurred 3M and Aearo to seek \"additional leverage\" through the bankruptcy proceedings, that did not create a legal need to protect 3M, Graham ruled.\n\nAttorneys representing the veterans with hearing loss said they looked forward to continuing their lawsuits against 3M in other courts.\n\n\"Judge Graham's decision is a complete rejection of 3M's attempt to evade accountability and hide in bankruptcy after multiple juries found it liable for knowingly causing hearing damage to those who served our nation,\" plaintiff attorneys Bryan Aylstock and Christopher Seeger said in a statement.\n\nA spokesman for 3M said it intended to appeal. 3M has set aside $1 billion to settle the earplug litigation.\n\n\"Continuing to litigate these cases one-by-one over the coming years will not provide certainty or fairness for any party,\" 3M spokesman Sean Lynch said.\n\n3M subsidiary Aearo Technologies LLC filed for bankruptcy protection in Indiana on July 26, seeking to resolve lawsuits alleging that 3M's Combat Arms Earplugs Version 2 (CAEv2) caused hearing loss.\n\nThe lawsuits have been consolidated in federal court in Florida and have grown into the largest mass tort litigation in U.S. history. Aearo placed $1 billion in a trust to settle them and agreed to indemnify 3M for all liability related to CAEv2.\n\n3M has denied liability, saying its earplugs offered protection to soldiers while allowing them to hear on the battlefield.\n\n",

         "Neogen CEO John Adent on Wednesday touted the company's deal to merge with 3M 's food-safety unit, telling CNBC's Jim Cramer it improves revenue growth opportunities and fuels innovation on emerging technologies such as the blockchain.\n\nNeogen — which makes animal health-care products and food safety tests, including those that can be used to detect pathogens and allergens — announced merger plans Tuesday. The news sent the Michigan-based company's stock higher by 8.2% Tuesday, although it gave back some of those gains Wednesday when it lost 1.34%.\n\nCombining with 3M's food-safety unit \"doubles the size of our business,\" Adent said in an interview on \"Mad Money.\" \"It really allows us to reach more customers more often with an unparalleled product offering. ... It's going to help us drive this industry forward through our data analytics platform and our blockchain solution that really increases the efficiency, traceability and enhance the food-safety protocols for customers.\"\n\nBlockchains are decentralized digital ledgers that are most commonly associated with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether. However, that's not its only use case.\n\nNeogen partnered with Ripe Technology nearly two years ago to start adapting the blockchain into its work on food safety diagnostics and animal genomics. The blockchain is helpful to Neogen because it \"permanently connects a tremendous amount of potentially critical data,\" Adent said in a release at the time.\n\nOn Wednesday, he further elaborated on how Neogen uses blockchain technology for food safety.\n\n\"When you go to the store and buy one of our customers' steaks and you take it home, if you send me a sample, I'm going to be able to tell you where that animal lived, what that animal ate, all the inputs into that animal, every single stop along the way until it got to your dinner plate,\" Adent told Cramer.",

         "The Lowe's logo is displayed on the front of the store near Bloomsburg.\n\nCheck out the companies making the biggest moves midday:\n\nLowe's — Shares fell 5.56% after the home improvement retailer's fiscal fourth-quarter sales fell short of Wall Street's expectations, with revenue coming in at $22.45 billion versus the $22.69 billion estimate from Refinitiv. While it topped EPS estimates, Lowe's gave sales guidance for 2023 that missed expectations.\n\n3M — The stock gained 2.29% following 3M's announcement that Department of Defense records show the vast majority of the claimants in the Combat Arms earplug litigation against the company have no hearing impairment.\n\nFirst Horizon — Shares sank 10.62% after its acquisition by Toronto-Dominion Bank was delayed. TD informed First Horizon that it doesn't expect the necessary regulatory approvals to be received in time to complete the merger by May 27, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. TD said it could not provide a new projected closing at this time, but said in an email to Bloomberg that it was committed to the transaction.\n\nSarepta Therapeutics — The biotech stock surged 19.24% after Morgan Stanley upgraded it to overweight from equal weight.

First Solar reported a fourth-quarter loss of 7 cents per share compared with a 17 cent per-share loss expected by analysts surveyed by FactSet. The company's revenue was in line with analysts' expectations of $1 billion.\n\nAMC Entertainment — Shares of the movie-theater chain dropped 7.98% a day after AMC reported a wider-than-expected loss for the fourth quarter. AMC lost 26 cents per share, compared with the 21 cents expected by analysts according to Refinitiv, even though revenue came in ahead of estimates.\n\nWarby Parker — The stock lost 5.76% after being downgraded to neutral from buy by Citi, who said the eyeglass company's growth outlook was \"too blurry.\"\n\nRed Robin Gourmet Burgers — The restaurant chain's stock soared 27.14%.

         "Morgan Stanley downgrades 3M to underweight, sees legal issues and weak growth holding stock back",
         "The market appears to be underestimating the hit 3M is going to take from ongoing lawsuits, creating downside risk for investors, according to Morgan Stanley. Analyst Joshua Pokrzywinski downgraded the stock to underweight from equal weight, saying in a note to clients that the company's fundamentals would struggle to overcome the hit from lawsuits over an ear protection product and the use of chemicals known as PFAS. \"Our analysis of Combat Arms implies that the market's estimate of PFAS has declined (despite negative news flow) or that valuation of the core business is too high,\" Pokrzywinski said. \"While we see the fundamental picture improving through price/cost, overall organic growth remains cloudy as priority platforms are muted by a large, stable portfolio that struggles to outgrow IP given its sheer size and global ubiquity.\" Morgan Stanley cut its price target for 3M to $150 per share from $185. The stock closed at $154.14 on Wednesday. Shares were off 1.9% in premarket trading Thursday. 3M has been named in thousands of lawsuits over its Combat Arms earplug product, which it discontinued in 2015, according to 3M. For the perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, lawsuits, 3M has already logged hundreds of millions of dollars in pretax charges and could have to take more hits in the future. At the same time, 3M has seen its sales and earnings grow at a slower rate than its peers in recent years, Morgan Stanley said. \"In other words, after taking into account weaker fundamental performance we think the market appears to be understating the combined liabilities from Combat Arms and PFAS by ~$15B,\" the analyst said. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.\n\nTraders work under monitors displaying 3M Co. signage on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York.

Microsoft (MSFT) shares sink nearly 3% early Wednesday, pressuring the broader market after the Dow Jones Industrial Average , the S & P 500 and the Nasdaq . Microsoft's fiscal second-quarter earnings beat estimates. Revenue missed. Guidance short. CEO Satya Nadella excited about OpenAI's ChatGPT. But CFO Amy Hood plays grim reaper halfway through the call. Maturing tech. MUST WAIT UNTIL AMY. Only thing that matters. Azure cloud sales up 38% year over year in constant currency. Lots of price target cuts by Wall Street analysts, but they largely keep their buy ratings. The Club has MSFT at our 2 rating , meaning we'd like to see more pullback before considering buying more. 2. 3M (MMM) was bad. I mean terrible on every line item for the quarter. Full-year sales decline of 2% to 6%, worse than estimates at the midpoint. You have to wonder what the heck management is going to do besides come up with a new kind of scotch tape. Multiple PT cuts on the Street. The industrial giant announces 2,500 manufacturing job cuts . 3. Boeing (BA) reports big fourth-quarter loss. Supply chain snarls outweigh surging travel demand as the world learns to live with Covid. Aircraft manufacturing suffered during the height of the pandemic. Revenue of $19.98 billion fell short of estimates. Reaffirms guidance on Max and Dreamliner. Positive annual free cash flow. 4. AT & T (T) fourth-quarter earnings beat but revenue misses. Not great but better than Verizon (VZ). Full-year guidance free cash flow of $16 billion or better versus $16.2 billion expected. FCF in 2022 was $14.1 billion. Increase in subscribers but annual profit outlook below expectations. 5. JPMorgan cuts Ford (F) price target to $15 per share from $16 and General Motors (GM) PT to $57 from $59; keeps overweight (buy) ratings on both. Analysts at JPMorgan also cut Tesla (TSLA) price target to $120 from $125; keep underweight (sell) rating. Tesla shares bounce 16% year to date but still down over 53% over the past 12 months. Elon Musk's electric vehicle maker is set to report quarterly results after the closing bell Wednesday. 6. Baird keeps Danaher (DHR) at an overweight (buy) rating but cuts price target to $309 per share from $321. Analysts say the life sciences and medical diagnostics company now derisked from Covid. We saw Tuesday's DHR stock drop after largely solid quarterly results was a buying opportunity. 7. Barclays raises price target on SLB (SLB) to $74 per share from $62. Already in the stock? That's the question with all oil and gas companies. I say no. We had the nation's strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) being emptied, and there's no shortage of places that are being drilled. Instead of SLB, we own oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL), which reported a strong quarter Tuesday. 8. Bank of America (BAC) gives employees who make up to $500,000 a year restricted stock.

         "It will be a tough road for 3M before its stock can catch up to the broader market, according to RBC Capital Markets. Analyst Deane Dray downgraded 3M to underperform from sector perform, saying in a note to clients Tuesday night that the company had little upside for the foreseeable future. \"We are downgrading MMM from Sector Perform to Underperform as the company faces mounting operating and legal challenges in 2022. Ongoing inflation/supply chain pressures have exposed fundamental weaknesses in 3M's price/cost actions that are unlikely to be remedied soon,\" Dray wrote. Shares of the industrial company underperformed the broader market in 2021 and are still trading near pre-pandemic levels, compared to a roughly 40% gain for the S & P 500. RBC slashed its price target to $166 per share from $199. The new target is nearly 8% below where the stock closed on Tuesday. Shares fell 1% in premarket trading Wednesday. On the legal front, 3M is facing challenges in multiple areas related to its use of a class of chemical substances known as PFAS. The company's \"litigation outlook will get much worse before it gets better,\" according to RBC. \"Along with headline risk, we believe 3M will likely have to take more legal reserves to address its mounting PFAS and military hearing-loss litigation,\" the note said. -CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.\n\nTraders work under monitors displaying 3M Co. signage on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York.

         "With I.P.O.’s on the rise, analysts get new scrutiny",
         "Read more from The New York Times:\n\nBlackBerry to explore its strategic alternatives, including a sale\n\nCampbell Soup to sell some European operations\n\nDole's chief to buy out company for $13.50 a share\n\nInterviewing analysts as part of the process of going public has become more prevalent, several analysts said, with the proliferation of so-called I.P.O. advisers, firms that advise companies in the early stages of an offering. These firms are paid to help companies and, often, their private equity owners screen banks vying to take companies public. Among other things, they arrange for meetings between companies and the Wall Street analysts and bankers.\n\n\"If you are going to see the people who are screening the underwriters you are there for one purpose, to win banking business,\" said another Wall Street analyst, who also requested anonymity because his company prohibits employees from speaking to the media without prior approval. This analyst said he knew of the practice but had not taken part in any meetings.\n\nParticipants say company meetings with the analysts and bankers are held separately, but can happen within hours of each other, and banks rarely send compliance officers to monitor the discussions. Analysts say that when private equity executives are involved, the sessions can turn especially uncomfortable, veering into questions about a company's valuation.\n\nSolebury Capital, Rothschild and Lazard are among the leading firms in this area. Solebury has recently guided a number of companies through the I.P.O. process, including the discount retailer Five Below; Bloomin' Brands, which owns Outback Steakhouse and Bonefish Grill; and HD Supply Holdings, according to regulatory filings.\n\nIn an interview, Solebury's co-chief executives, Alan Sheriff and Ted Hatfield, said that their corporate clients meet with analysts as well as bankers as they work through the offering process, but that the meetings with analysts are \"informational,\" regarding general market trends.\n\n\"Pitching investment banking in analyst meetings is strictly off limits,\" Mr. Sheriff said.\n\n\n\n(Read more: Hot IPO Cvent praises JOBS Act, talks disruption)\n\nA senior research executive at one major Wall Street firm says he thinks it is acceptable for an analyst to have a broad chat with a company looking to go public, and the analyst can benefit from that meeting by learning more about the industry. But he expressed concern about meetings with companies in the process of choosing banks to underwrite their I.P.O.'s.\n\n\"I am not O.K. with a third party organizing a beauty contest with the express purpose of winning banking business,\" said the executive, whose firm has a policy against speaking to the media. \"The problem is, the analyst going to the meeting knows the purpose and couldn't help but feel pressured. You are selling your bank.\"\n\nInvestors both large and small often rely on the recommendations of analysts, who issue buy and sell recommendations on stocks. Questions about the legitimacy of Wall Street research came into focus during the height of the Internet and telecommunications bubble. During that heady time, analysts worked closely with banking colleagues to secure profitable I.P.O. assignments from fast-growing tech companies.\n\nMr. Spitzer, as attorney general, spearheaded an investigation that helped solidify his reputation at the time as the \"sheriff of Wall Street.\" He released incriminating e-mails that showed analysts privately disparaged the very companies they were publicly telling investors to buy. They also showed how influential investment bankers were in securing positive research reports for companies that were either clients of a firm or prospective customers.\n\nIn one e-mail, an investor asked Henry Blodget, then a Merrill Lynch analyst, what was so interesting about GoTo.com, an Internet company he was recommending, except for the banking fees that it generated.\n\n\n\n(Read more: Seeking capital, some companies turn to 'do-it-yourself I.P.O.'s')\n\n\"Nothing,\" Mr. Blodget replied.\n\nIn another e-mail message, Mr. Blodget called InfoSpace, an Internet company that he favored publicly, \"a piece of junk.\"\n\nFederal regulators barred Mr. Blodget, who now runs Business Insider, a business news Web site, and Jack B. Grubman, another prominent analyst who worked at Salomon Smith Barney, from the securities industry.\n\nIn 2003, 10 Wall Street banks agreed to pay a collective $1.4 billion to resolve the government's accusations. As part of the settlement, the firms agreed to separate their banking and research departments, a move that regulators said would ensure that analysts operated more autonomously.\n\nAnalysts were also expressly \"prohibited from participating in efforts to solicit investment banking business,\" including pitches and road shows. Over the years, that language has been incorporated into rules policed by Finra, the regulator.",

         "A Wild Night of Surprises at the NFL Draft 9:10 AM ET Fri, 26 April 2013\n\nAll of those forces resulted in the once-unthinkable on Thursday night: He was not even chosen in the first round. That's right—32 teams had the chance to select him, and 32 teams said \"no thank you.\"\n\n\n\nAnd he lost millions of dollars.\n\n\n\n(Read More: New Facebook Tool, Te'o Scandal Fan Flames of Privacy Debate)\n\nLook at it this way: If an NFL team picked Te'o at No. 5, he would have received a contract in the vicinity of four years and $20 million, with roughly half of that guaranteed. The millions from a rookie contract likely would have been matched by off-field endorsements.\n\n\n\nNone of that has materialized, and now he's looking at a contract that will pay him about half a million with, perhaps, $2 million guaranteed.\n\n\n\nThat's a net loss of at least $8 million.\n\n\n\n\"Even if he plays 10 years in the league, this is millions over the first four years that he never gets back,\" said sports economist Patrick Rishe. \"His endorsement value took an even bigger hit.\"\n\n\n\n\"Here's a guy who was a hot commodity during his senior year at Notre Dame,\" he said. \"If he performs well in the national championship game, if there isn't a story about the hoax girlfriend, and he had performed well at the combines, not only is he going to be picked in the top 10 and earn more money, but he's going to be more likely to get the endorsement deals.\"\n\n\n\n(Read More: Get a Fake Facebook Girlfriend for $20)\n\nTe'o must have known there was a possibility that he would not be picked because he did not attend the Radio City festivities at all Thursday night, avoiding the awkward possibility of multiple camera shots of him waiting in the green room as team after team passed him by.\n\n\n\nThat's what happened to West Virginia quarterback Geno Smith, and he was so upset that he declined all interviews afterward.\n\n\n\nSmith was projected as the top quarterback in the draft, but there was only one QB picked in the first round. His name was EJ Manuel and not Geno Smith.\n\n\n\nAs for Te'o, he assuredly will get drafted at some point.\n\n\n\nThe rest is up to him.\n\n\n\n\"If he plays and performs well, if he's a marketable player, if he's great in the community, all of those (other) things get washed away,\" Rishe said.\n\n\n\nBut as you just saw, that is a lot of \"ifs.\"",

         "Replacing O'Neal: Who Waits in The Wings?",
         "If Merrill Lynch Chief Executive Stan O'Neal is forced out, there's little doubt who the firm's army of more than 16,000 brokers would like to see replace him: their own boss.\n\nRobert McCann, president of Merrill Lynch's global private client business, has emerged as a potential candidate to replace the embattled O'Neal. Other candidates include BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink and NYSE Euronext CEO John Thain as possible replacements.\n\nO'Neal's grip on Merrill has weakened after the company posted its biggest quarterly loss in its history. O'Neal admitted this week he and his team misjudged the company's exposure to subprime mortgages, triggering an $8.4 billion write-down in the third quarter.\n\nMcCann looked to have been sidelined just a few months ago after his direct reporting line to O'Neal was severed. But now he's making a comeback.\n\n\"If naming your CEO was a popularity contest, Stan would be out and McCann would be in. But we know it doesn't work that way,\" said a Merrill Lynch executive, who declined to be named.\n\nIt's unclear if McCann has enough recognition among Merrill Board members, a group put together during O'Neal's tenure.\n\nBut Tom Sowanick, chief investment officer of Clearbrook Financial in Princeton, N.J., said McCann has the experience and leadership skills to run Merrill. Sowanick, a former Merrill Lynch wealth management strategist, worked for McCann before leaving the company.\n\n\"Bob is a very demanding yet capable leader. He will be able to shepherd Merrill Lynch out of this storm,\" Sowanick said.\n\nFink's candidacy has gathered steam because he is considered one of the top U.S. bond managers. He also is seen as someone who can remedy Merrill Lynch's fixed-income problems.\n\nThain has a blue-chip Wall Street resume, with credentials sharpened by running NYSE and his time as a former co-president at Goldman Sachs.\n\nA spokeswoman for BlackRock, an asset manager in which Merrill holds a large stake, declined to comment, saying the company does not comment on market speculation and rumors. NYSE spokesmen were not immediately available to comment.\n\nMerrill's retail brokers have already lost confidence in O'Neal, thanks to the massive writedowns that happened on his watch. And some brokers are nervous that Merrill could be an attractive takeover target for a foreign bank. The company's depressed stock price and nearly $2 trillion in client assets might spur action from bidders.\n\nDeutsche Bank analyst Mike Mayo said Merrill could fetch $100 to $120 a share in a takeover. That's a 90 percent premium over the company's current trading price.\n\nA report in the New York Times Friday said O'Neal directed investment bank head Greg Fleming to approach Wachovia about a merger. Dick Bove, an analyst at Punk Ziegel & Co., said the overture \"may indicate some panic on Mr. O'Neal's part.\"\n\nMany investors share the brokers' feelings about O'Neal, who the Times said has also angered the board by authorizing the Wachovia talks without consulting with it.\n\nMerrill Lynch declined comment for this story.\n\n\"We're clearly disappointed in Stan O'Neal...\" one of Merrill's largest investors said on condition of anonymity.\n\nCNBC learned on Friday that O'Neal had conceded to friends he could be out of a job by the end of the weekend.",

         "Game Of G-E-I-C-O Will Be All-Star Weekend Highlight",
         "When the NBA needed something to spice up its All-Star Saturday night — as the Slam Dunk Contest (since 1984) and the three-point contest (since 1986) got stale — they unveiled the Skills Challenge in 2003.\n\nWhat they should have done was unveiled the game of H-O-R-S-E. The league will realize this when the game is played by Kevin Durant, Joe Johnson and O.J. Mayo on TNT's lead-up to Saturday night's festivities. The idea was dreamed up by the network to create some action around \"Inside the NBA,\" which will be set up outside US Airways Arena and will broadcast live with Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith and Chris Webber from 5 to 7 p.m. ET on Saturday night.\n\nIt's easy to see why this is going to be popular. As someone who has seen pros play a game of horse, or something close to it, it's really exciting. They'll play on a 45-by-50 foot court, where something called the NBA All-Star Block Party is being held. They'll wear microphones so you can hear them call every shot and there is, of course, no dunking allowed.\n\n\"Everyone played H-O-R-S-E as a kid,\" said Jon Diament, executive vice president of ad sales and marketing for Turner. \"Who has played slam dunk?\"\n\nExcept, and you might have heard this, the guys aren't playing H-O-R-S-E. They are actually playing G-E-I-C-O, thanks to the insurance company paying a premium for the name change. They'll also get scoreboard signage and on-air graphics and probably get an incredible bang for the buck.\n\nThe only thing we can think of that we thought Geico should have done was to pay a former NBA player to wear a caveman outfit and try to beat the current guys. Not only would you get people to laugh while working in one of your brand mascots, but if the caveman actually won it would generate actual news stories. The last time that was done successfully was when Nokia had a dressed up rabbit win a road race it sponsored. Diament said there will be no geckos or cavemen on the court this time around.\n\nThe competition is set to start at 6 p.m. ET and we figure there's enough of a pad so that if it gets ridiculous, they'll be done by the time they have to be off the air by 7 p.m. But to us, this is the most exciting part of the weekend, including the game.\n\nIt's why we're saying it here right now that next year's Saturday night ticket will get you a seat into the arena to see H-O-R-S-E, or G-E-I-C-O, or whatever it's called then.\n\nQuestions?

         "Europe's biggest medical device maker, Smith & Nephew, is close to bidding about $11 billion for its U.S. rival Biomet, sources familiar with the situation said Sunday (Play-By-Play: Conditions Right For More Merger Mania).\n\nOne of the sources told Reuters bids were due by Tuesday and other companies were also likely to submit offers for Biomet.\n\nS&N, which would not comment, said on Nov. 2 it had held \"very preliminary talks\" over a tie-up with Biomet. Combining S&N and Biomet would help the two companies close the gap on the\n\nmarket leaders for joint implants -- U.S. groups Johnson & Johnson, Stryker and Zimmer.\n\nAnalysts have said a tie-up would probably take the form of an offer by S&N for Biomet pitched at between $10.5 billion and $12 billion, although a deal between the two is not certain since the U.S. company is likely to attract interest from rivals.\n\nS&N has long been tipped as a bidder for Biomet, which hired investment bank Morgan Stanley in April to consider its strategic options after long-time Chief Executive Dane Miller resigned.\n\nA source close to the matter told Reuters earlier in the year that the two companies held talks this summer, but no offer was made at the time.\n\nHigher Margins\n\nS&N Chief Executive Chris O'Donnell has said in the past he saw disadvantages to S&N being smaller than its major U.S. rivals and economies of scale could help improve margins.\n\nBut he has also cautioned that achieving cost savings in sales forces would not be easy, given the specialist nature of the products being sold.\n\nThe move on Biomet marks S&N's second recent attempt to grow via large-scale acquisition. It bid for Switzerland's Centerpulse in 2003, only to be beaten out by Zimmer. It may face stiff competition this time round, too.\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph newspaper reported that S&N could face rival trade buyers such as Johnson & Johnson, Stryker and Zimmer, while the Sunday Times newspaper said a private equity bidder may prove the main opposition for S&N.\n\nS&N itself is regularly rumored as a takeover target for larger U.S. peers and industry analysts believe an unsuccessful attempt to acquire Biomet could leave it vulnerable.\n\nMakers of joint implants have enjoyed strong sales growth in the past few years, driven by technological innovation, an aging population and increased demand for elective surgery among the \"baby boomers.\" But more recently investors have become concerned about pressure on prices charged for devices.",

         "House G.O.P. to Plan Next Step as Budget Clock Runs Down",
         "House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Getty Images\n\nWASHINGTON — House Republicans will meet in a rare Saturday session as they plan their next move to keep the government open past midnight on Monday while extracting major concessions on President Obama's health care law. The Senate turned up the pressure on the House on Friday, passing a stopgap spending bill that would keep the government financed through Nov. 15 while leaving the health care law intact. Now, House Republicans must decide whether to accept the measure, attach minor changes to the health care law that could win Democratic support, or confront the Senate anew by again tying further government financing to a gutting of the law. Any move short of passing the Senate bill is likely to shut down the government, at least briefly, unless it is accompanied by a measure that would finance the government for at least a few days. That would allow the Republican to keep their struggle alive.\n\n(Read more: Why markets should pray for a US government shutdown)\n\nwatch now\n\nIn his Saturday radio and Internet address, the president will accuse Republicans in the House of being \"more concerned with appeasing an extreme faction of their party than working to pass a budget that creates new jobs or strengthens the middle class,\" according to a transcript released in advance. \"And in the next couple days, these Republicans will have to decide whether to join the Senate and keep the government open, or create a crisis that will hurt people for the sole purpose of advancing their ideological agenda,\" he adds. \"The American people have worked too hard to recover from crisis to see extremists in their Congress cause another one.\"\n\nRepresentative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, will use the Republican radio address on Saturday to shift the debate to another important deadline, Oct. 17, when Congress must raise the government's statutory borrowing limit or risk a potentially catastrophic default on the national debt.\n\nMore from The New York Times: U.S. and Iran Agree to Speed Talks Over Nuclear Dispute\n\nRace to the End for 'Breaking Bad' Binge-Viewers\n\nInKenya Attack, Narrow Escapes and Questions \"The president is now demanding that we increase the debt limit without engaging in any kind of bipartisan discussions about addressing our spending problem,\" Ms. Rodgers said. \"He wants to take the easy way out — exactly the kind of foolishness that got us here in the first place.\"\n\nCongressional Republicans are waging a two-front political war: one with Mr. Obama and the Democrats, the other within their own ranks.\n\nThe House Republicans' meeting, which is to begin at noon, is intended to produce spending legislation that is coupled with Republican health care demands, and the measure would face a vote on Sunday. That would leave the Senate just one day to deal with the House legislation before much of the government closes down for lack of funds. Without unanimous support in the Senate, the rules of the chamber would never let any such measure pass that quickly.\n\nwatch now",

         "If you're introverted, you might not want a job that requires constant meetings or working in large groups of people.\n\nWhile some jobs might be more tailored to extroverts, dozens of high-paying roles allow introverts to leverage their natural tendencies and unique strengths.\n\nResume Genius recently curated a list of 15 high-paying jobs with strong job growth projections that are well-suited for introverts.\n\nTo compile the list, researchers looked at recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and O*NET Online and identified roles that are compatible with common introverted traits and preferences including creative thinking, deep engagement, autonomy and meaningful interactions. Then, Resume Genius picked out jobs that paid a minimum annual salary of $56,240 and had strong 10-year outlooks, according to BLS data.\n\nWhether you're someone who prefers to work in quiet environments or simply want the flexibility to work independently, consider pursuing one of these careers:\n\n1.

Graphic designer\n\nMedian annual salary: $57,990\n\nWhile jobs in tech or finance are big draws for introverts, as these industries are conducive to introverted tendencies such as independent work and creative problem-solving, other non-tech roles are equally suitable for this personality type, Eva Chan, a career expert at Resume Genius, tells CNBC Make It.\n\nThat includes millwrights, who install, maintain and repair construction machinery, as well as occupational health and safety specialists, who conduct assessments and analyze data related to workplace safety.\n\n\"Introverts have a unique professional strength: when they need to learn something new, they're often happy to dive in and require little supervision or external help,\" Chan says. \"This capacity to self-start and carry out independent research not only distinguishes introverts from other personality types but also makes them highly valuable in any job that emphasizes autonomy and initiative.\"\n\nTo land one of these roles, Chan recommends using \"introvert-friendly\" job search methods like networking online in forums or groups on LinkedIn and Slack that align with your interests and career aspirations.\n\nWhen it comes to networking, introverts don't have to stretch too far outside of their comfort zone, Chan adds. Instead, you should focus on \"quality over quantity\" by looking for smaller, more intimate networking opportunities (like a one-on-one informational interview) with colleagues and industry peers, which can make it easier to forge genuine relationships.\n\nYou can also use your resume or cover letter to highlight specific instances where your independent actions at work led to tangible outcomes, such as solving a complex problem, innovating a process or contributing to a project's overall success.\n\nWant to land your dream job in 2024?

         "(This is CNBC Pro's live coverage of Wednesday's analyst calls and Wall Street chatter. Please refresh every 20-30 minutes to view the latest posts.) Analyst chatter on Wednesday featured Nvidia and another possible way to capitalize on the artificial intelligence craze. Several analysts raised their price targets on Nvidia after the company's GTC Conference, in which the chipmaker unveiled a new graphics processing unit. Elsewhere, Barclays reinstated coverage of Broadcom, noting the stock could be an alternative AI play. Check out the latest calls and chatter below.

The bank upgraded the packaging and paper products company on Tuesday to buy from neutral and raised its price target to $46 from $36, suggesting nearly 19% upside from Tuesday's close. International Paper on Tuesday named Andy Silvernail its new CEO, effective May 1. The stock popped 11% on the news.The company has been long burdened with an overly complex portfolio and has chronically underperformed, Citi analyst Anthony Pettinari said in a note to clients. \"While outgoing CEO Mark Sutton made major strides in simplifying IP's portfolio (White Paper spin, China/India/Russia exit, asset sales), we view the job as partly done. Mr. Silvernail is an outsider and a potential change agent,\" he wrote. Pettinari believes priorities include divesting underperforming assets and fixing its box business. He also expects Silvernail to address the performance gap with competitor Packaging Corp of America. — Michelle Fox 8:08 a.m.: Telsey Advisory Group upgrades Best Buy, sees more than 20% upside ahead Telsey Advisory Group upgraded Best Buy to outperform from market perform on Wednesday, a day after meeting with the retailer's management, including CEO Corrie Barry.

In fact, Best Buy is already seeing positive comparables in select categories like laptops, he said. Product innovation is also on the rise, which should help attract consumers and fuel growth, he added. In addition, the company is being cautious on capital spending, he said. Shares of Best Buy added more than 2% in premarket trading. — Michelle Fox 7:57 a.m.: Citi upgrades Tencent Music to buy after fourth-quarter report Tencent Music Entertainment may have found a path to steady growth and a higher stock price, according to Citi Analyst.

Tencent's total revenue for the fourth quarter was down year over year, but its subscription business grew. \"We believe TME's steady/resilient subscription music business with expanding capabilities of music value chain and ramp-up of long-form audio and diversified use case scenarios across multi-channels/devices would support sustained growth outlook,\" Yap said in a note to clients. Those subscriptions are expected to continue to be the key driver for the business moving forward. \"For 2024, management is confident that the online music business will maintain solid growth with subscription services serving as a primary driving force while continuing to explore new opportunities in advertising and artist merchandise to grow the business,\" the note said. Citi hiked its price target on Tencent Music to $13 per share from $9.

Analyst Nitin Kumar also raised his price target to $200 from $195, implying a 28% increase from the stock's Tuesday closing price. Chevron stock has added 5% so far this year. Kumar noted that the stock began the year outperforming its peers due to strong fourth-quarter earnings, until the company filed its proposed acquisition of Hess. \"Since then the stock has underperformed peers by ~6% as investors are concerned whether the deal will be completed since XOM and its partners are moving to,\" he wrote. Kumar's base case assumption still shows the deal going through, just with a Sep 30 close date versus June 30. Additionally, the analyst expects total production for Chevron to grow at a compound annual growth rate of between 10% to 11%, assuming that the Hess acquisition closes at the end of the third quarter. He also sees the company's current net asset value as looking attractive. \"Although the HES acquisition is ~7% accretive to NAV in our opinion, we still see value in standalone CVX especially given the recent underperformance compared to peers,\" Kumar wrote. — Lisa Kailai Han 7:38 a.m.: Needham upgrades Carmax to buy Carmax could soon be the upswing once again as the used car market begins to look more like it did before the Covid pandemic, according to Needham. Analyst Chris Pierce upgraded the stock to buy from hold, saying in a note to clients that the used car market could be on the road to recovery after a rocky few years. \"We see potential for a multi-year recovery, with interest rate relief and rising used vehicle supply pushing down [average selling prices] and monthly payments. We are confident in our above-consensus FY25 and FY26 retail unit estimates, which assume KMX's share gains resume and its omni-channel investments pay off as units grow,\" the note said. And even with concerns about the U.S. consumer weakening, the Carmax loan book appears to be in good shape, Pierce said. \"KMX's December loan default commentary was a positive surprise, with higher value loans on higher ASP vehicles seeing elevated early defaults, but subsequently reverting toward expectations as the loans season,\" the note said. Needham set a price target of $99 per share for Carmax, which is about 22% above where the stock closed Tuesday. — Jesse Pound 7:34 a.m.: Chipotle shares can continue rising amid strong growth, Deutsche Bank says Deutsche Bank sees more room to run for Chipotle shares as the fast-casual Mexican chain continues growing. Analyst Lauren Silberman raised her price target by $200 to $3,300 per share, which now implies an upside of 18% over Tuesday's close. Silberman also reiterated her buy rating. In a note titled \"Guac Costs Extra and So Does Growth,\" Silberman said she has high conviction in the near-term and long-term growth outlooks for the stock. The analyst said a premium multiple is deserved, given that there's few high-quality U.S. companies with clean balance sheets, strong fundamentals and the potential to see upside to performance metrics. \"CMG has been among the best-performing restaurant stocks and we expect fundamental strength to continue to drive outperformance,\" she wrote to clients. Silberman also praised Chipotle for its visibility into the path to 30% on margins. Its \"best-in-class\" unit economics offer another quality to like, she said. On Tuesday, Chipotle said its board approved a 50-to-1 stock split . The change is expected to go into effect in June if approved by shareholders earlier that month. Shares of Chipotle rose more than 6% in Wednesday premarket trading. The stock has climbed more than 22% this year. CMG YTD mountain CMG year to date — Alex Harring 7:31 a.m.: Spotify shares could still gain nearly 25%, according to Bank of America Bank of America is increasingly confident in Spotify's long-term potential. The firm maintained its buy rating on the streaming company and also raised its price target by $50 to $315, which suggests shares could climb 24.6%. The stock has already jumped more than 35% this year. \"The company is now at an inflection point which is driving share price performance over the last ~18 months and we are confident in the sustainability of this momentum driven by: 1) subscriber growth, 2) monetization opportunities (e.g. price increases), 3) scaling of advertising driven in large part by podcasting, 4) continued operating leverage,\" analyst Jessica Ehrlich wrote in a Wednesday note, adding that first-quarter earnings should come out at least in line with guidance. Spotify is on track to see positive gross margins, operating income and free cash flow, according to Ehrlich. The company's free cash flow trajectory and strong balance sheet pave the way for it to initiate a share repurchase program, which could boost shares higher in the second half of this year, the analyst added. — Pia Singh 6:48 a.m.: JPMorgan upgrades bitcoin mining firm Riot Platforms, forecasts more than 35% upside Investors should look to bitcoin mining company Riot Platforms after the recent increase in bitcoin prices, according to JPMorgan. Although shares on Tuesday declined to their lowest level, $11.09, since the Securities and Exchange Commission's bitcoin ETF approval, analyst Reginald Smith remains optimistic and upgraded the stock to overweight from neutral. His $15 price target assumes a $60,000 bitcoin price and suggests 35.2% potential upside for the stock. Smith cited the Riot's decline as a result of the stagnant hashrate growth, equity dilution and broader industry profit taking. \"We like Riot's unique combination of industry-leading power contracts, scale and liquidity (Riot last reported ~$600M in cash and $470M worth of bitcoin), and think shares offer the best relative upside among the three largest and most liquid U.S.-listed mining stocks,\" Smith wrote in a Wednesday note. Riot shares are down more than 28% year to date. RIOT YTD mountain RIOT in 2024 — Pia Singh 6:23 a.m.: Citi downgrades Wells Fargo Citi downgraded Wells Fargo to neutral from buy, saying the bank's valuation has already priced in the potential for earnings per share revisions. Analyst Keith Horowitz raised his target price by $6 to $63, however, which implies the stock could gain 10.5% from Tuesday's close. Shares are up 15.8% year to date. \"We continue to see tailwinds from fixed asset repricing, growth across fee categories and improved efficiency, but our estimates are not too far above the Street. With WFC trading at a premium relative to peers on our implied cost of equity metric, we believe the risk/reward is fairly balanced,\" analyst Horowitz wrote in a Tuesday note, saying Wells Fargo has been one of his top picks among the G-SIBs, or global systemically important banks. — Pia Singh 6:03 a.m.: Netflix shares should 'trade at a premium,' according to KeyBanc KeyBanc Capital Markets thinks Netflix can grow consistently going forward. Analyst Justin Patterson maintained his overweight rating and upped his price target by $125 to $705, suggesting shares of the streaming giant could gain 13.6% over the next year. He also increased his earnings per share estimates for this year and 2024. \"We continue to see signs that: 1) Netflix's content quality is improving; and 2) in our view, this creates a clear catalyst path as engagement should drive a monetization ramp (both in price increases and ad revenue),\" Patterson wrote in a Tuesday, anticipating Netflix to have a more balanced growth between subscribers and monetization over the medium term. \"Given more recurring revenue, an emerging ad revenue stream, and consistent 20%+ EPS growth, we believe NFLX should trade at a premium to peers.\" Netflix shares are up 27.5% so far this year. — Pia Singh 5:55 a.m.: Analysts think Nvidia is still a buy after GTC conference Several analysts remain bullish on Nvidia after the darling chipmaker's artificial intelligence GTC conference this week, during which CEO Jensen Huang gave a two-hour keynote speech about Nvidia's growing lineup of software and hardware products. Here's what some of them had to say: Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer raised his price target on the stock to $1,100, implying upside of 23%. \"Nvidia has transformed from a graphics company to a premier leading AI computing platform company. GPUs were initially used for graphics in video games and film. Given its parallel processing capabilities and thousands of computing cores, GPU are now optimized for deep learning AI algorithms in datacenters.\" Piper Sandler hiked its price target to $1,050 from $850, noting: \"We view the new architecture as an expansion of the already dominant market positioning of NVDA's hardware offering. We maintain that NVDA is the leading company in offering the full hardware and software stack to address the decade long transition to accelerated computing and generative AI.\" The new price target implies upside of 17.5%. Bank of America reiterated its buy rating and $1,100 price target, naming Nvidia a \"top compute pick\" following the conference. Blackwell's pricing should allow Nvidia to sustain mid-70% gross margins, and adoption of the new chips could be among the fastest in company history given its affordability across various customer bases, analyst Vivek Arya said. Nvidia shares closed at $893.98 on Tuesday. The stock — which is up 80.5% for the year — traded 0.2% lower in premarket trading. — Pia Singh 5:55 a.m.: Broadcom a strong play for '2nd wave of AI', Barclays says Looking for another way to capitalize on the artificial intelligence craze? Barclays thinks investors should look no further than Broadcom . The bank reinstated coverage of the semiconductor stock at an overweight rating. Its price target of $1,405 implies upside of nearly 14%. \"The company joins our preferred names this year as another way to play the 2nd Wave of AI via a best-in-class data center silicon portfolio,\" analyst Tom O'Malley wrote. \"In the near term, AI is all that matters and the custom silicon/switching businesses are driving a significant portion of near-term growth (we forecast a mid/high-20% range next year and for it to accelerate longer term).\" \"Outside of AI, the company is seeing many of the same cyclical downturns as Semi peers but a growing software business helps boost profitability and [free cash flow] generation,\" he said. Broadcom shares are up 10% year to date, lagging Nvidia — which has soared 80%. That said, Broadcom is outperforming the S & P 500's 8.6% gain. AVGO YTD mountain AVGO year to date — Fred Imbert",

         "BELFAST, NORTHERN IRELAND - FEBRUARY 3: First Minister Michelle O'Neill speaks during proceedings of the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont on February 3, 2024 in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\n\nLONDON — A referendum on Irish reunification could be in the cards within a decade, according to Northern Ireland's first-ever nationalist first minister, who took office at the weekend.\n\nSinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill was appointed as first minister on Saturday, the first Irish nationalist to hold the office since Northern Ireland was founded as a Protestant-majority state in 1921. The Democratic Unionist Party's Emma Little-Pengelly was appointed deputy first minister.\n\nIt came after the Northern Ireland Assembly, the country's devolved parliament, reconvened for the first time in two years on Saturday after the U.K. loyalist DUP reached a deal with the British government to end a boycott over post-Brexit trade arrangements.\n\nThe island to the west of England is divided in two; Northern Ireland is part of the U.K., whereas its neighbor, the Republic of Ireland, is an independent nation and a member of the European Union.\n\nUntil now, Northern Ireland's first minister has always come from a British unionist party, but Sinn Fein, which advocates for Northern Ireland to rejoin the Republic, won the most seats in the assembly for the first time in 2022.\n\nThe DUP, Northern Ireland's largest British unionist party, boycotted the assembly in February 2022 in protest over post-Brexit trade rules and refused to return for two years, leaving the country of 1.9 million people without a functioning administration. The deal that secured its return includes a contribution of more than £3 billion ($3.8 billion) from the British government for Northern Ireland's public services.\n\nThe power-sharing rules of the assembly, enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement — a landmark 1998 peace deal that brought an end to three decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland — mean that the executive, which runs the country, must include both unionist and nationalist representatives.",

         "Children participate in an activity in class at the Xavier Academy on August 23, 2021 in Houston, Texas. In-person classroom sessions are resuming and schools around Houston are requiring mask mandates, keeping in accordance with CDC guidelines.\n\nA federal judge in Texas ruled Wednesday that Gov. Greg Abbott's executive order banning mask mandates in schools violates the Americans with Disabilities Act, setting the stage for school districts in the state to decide whether they want to impose mask rules.\n\nU.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel wrote in a 29-page ruling that the ADA, a federal law enacted in 1990, supersedes Abbott's July order banning facial coverings in schools.\n\n\"The spread of COVID-19 poses an even greater risk for children with special health needs. Children with certain underlying conditions who contract COVID-19 are more likely to experience severe acute biological effects and to require admission to a hospital and the hospital's intensive-care unit,\" Yeakel said. \"This includes children with conditions including, Down syndrome, organ transplants, lung conditions, heart conditions, and weakened immune systems.\"\n\nYeakel added, \"The evidence presented by Plaintiffs establishes that Plaintiffs are being denied the benefits of in-person learning on an equal basis as their peers without disabilities.\"\n\nThe ruling also prohibits Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton from enforcing the governor's order, which imposes a fine of up to $1,000 for any entity that issues a mask mandate.\n\nPaxton's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in August by families of students with disabilities and an advocacy group called Disability Rights Texas. The suit argued that Abbott's ban denies children with pre-existing conditions equal access to a safe education.\n\n\"Governor Abbott's executive order clearly violates federal law, and Attorney General Paxton's enforcement of the order against school districts is now stopped,\" said Kym Davis Rogers, an attorney for the group, in a statement.\n\n\"As the court found, Texas is not above federal law, and state officials cannot prevent school districts from providing accommodations to students who are especially vulnerable to the risks of COVID-19. We are thankful that school districts can now take the steps necessary to protect these students. No student should be forced to make the choice of forfeiting their education or risking their health, and now they won't have to.\"\n\nWednesday's ruling comes as GOP-led states such as Florida and Iowa have banned mask mandates in schools.\n\nThe majority of public schools in Texas began in-person classes in August. More than 210,000 students have tested positive for Covid-19, according to state data.\n\nThe Department of Justice filed a statement of interest in the Texas case in late September, arguing Abbott's executive order would harm students with disabilities.\n\n\"The serious adverse consequences on students with certain disabilities is readily foreseeable,\" the Justice Department wrote. \"Some parents of children at heightened COVID-19 risk will likely keep their children at home—even though the children could safely attend school if mask protocols could be put in place.\"",

         "Jim Cramer says Abbott Laboratories shares can go higher thanks to Covid delta surge",
         "CNBC's Jim Cramer said Tuesday he sees more near-term upside for shares of Abbott Laboratories as the U.S. grapples with the Covid delta variant.\n\nThe \"Mad Money\" host pointed specifically to the company's BinaxNOW coronavirus test, a self-administered diagnostic that can be bought over the counter at pharmacy chains like Walgreens and CVS .\n\n\"This Binax is now the hottest product on the market. Just as Abbott had to pre-announce how poorly Binax was doing, sometimes I wonder if they have to pre-announce to the upside now that it's doing so well,\" Cramer said.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration authorized Abbott Labs' rapid Covid test for at-home use in December, right around the time vaccines for the disease were cleared on an emergency use basis. As availability of the BinaxNOW test increased during the spring, so too did access to Covid vaccines, which helped drive down coronavirus infection levels across the country.\n\nNow, in recent weeks, coronavirus cases have jumped in the U.S., leading Cramer to believe more and more Americans are going to seek out Abbott Labs' rapid test.\n\n\"We've got so many antivaxxers in this country that they've kept the pandemic alive and now we've got new variants with a decent chance of breaking through the vaccines from Pfizer and, to a lesser extent, Moderna. You know what that means? Testing, testing, testing,\" Cramer said.\n\nThe Covid situation also is benefiting shares of Regeneron , which makes an antibody therapy to treat the disease, Cramer said.\n\n\"The tables have turned, the fortunes restored for Regeneron and Abbott Labs. Their stocks have been up all along with all the other slowdown winners,\" Cramer said, alluding to the fact shares of Regeneron and Abbott Labs are up 11% and 7%, respectively, in the past month. That compares with the S&P 500's roughly 2.8% gain in the same time period.\n\n\"Now they have another kicker, and I think they've still got higher to go,\" Cramer said.",

         "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order on Monday prohibiting any entity, including private businesses, from imposing Covid-19 vaccination requirements on employees or customers.\n\n\"The COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective, and our best defense against the virus, but should remain voluntary and never forced,\" said Abbott said in a statement.\n\nAbbott, a Republican, said in his order that it was prompted by the Biden administration's vaccine federal mandate, which the governor called federal overreach.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced a mandate last month requiring companies with 100 or more employees to ensure that their workforces are vaccinated or regularly tested. The Labor Department has yet to release details of the emergency rule, but Biden last week called on companies to act now and not to wait for the requirement to go into effect.\n\nAbbott, who tested positive for Covid in August, has also resisted mask mandates and requiring proof of vaccination in the state. The state has continued to experience a rise in cases and crowded hospitals, prompting the governor to invest in monoclonal antibody infusion centers.\n\nAbbott issued executive orders over the summer banning local governments and school districts from requiring either masks or vaccines, issuing a $1,000 fine to those who failed to comply. School districts in San Antonio and Dallas, however, have challenged the order in court. The state legislature also passed a bill in June banning private businesses requiring vaccination proof from customers.\n\nIn Monday's order, Abbott also sent a memo to the chief clerk of the state House of Representatives and the secretary of the state Senate requesting to codify the mandate in a bill. The governor said the order will be rescinded when the GOP-controlled legislature passes the bill.\n\nOther GOP-led states have taken similar approaches to Texas. Montana passed a bill banning vaccine requirements by employers. Earlier this year, Florida also banned businesses from requiring proof of vaccination.",

         "A worker delivers groceries to a customer's vehicle outside a Walmart Inc. store in Amsterdam, New York, on Friday, May 15, 2020.\n\nWalmart's political action committee donated to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's reelection campaign last month, as he geared up to fight a federal Covid-19 vaccine mandate, according to a new federal filing.\n\nThe donation came as the retail industry has expressed concerns about the mandate weighing on operations as the holiday shopping season approaches and America faces labor shortages.\n\nThe contribution also came after Abbott, a Republican who is up for reelection next year, signed a law that effectively bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, as well as legislation that includes voting restrictions.\n\nArkansas-based Walmart made the $10,000 donation, dated Sept. 29, through its \"PAC for sustainable government,\" according to a Federal Election Commission filing.\n\nThe mega retailer's donation to Abbott was the biggest contribution it gave to any state or federal elected official that month. The Walmart PAC also contributed $5,000 to Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, also a Republican.\n\nRecords show Walmart has contributed to both Abbott's and Patrick's campaigns in the past. The company has also contributed to Democrats.\n\n\"As a company that operates in all 50 states, it is necessary for us to engage political leaders from both parties across a broad spectrum of policy matters. Our company and PAC engage in a bipartisan manner based on a range of issues that impact our associates, customers and shareholders,\" a Walmart representative told CNBC.\n\n\"We have not been and will never be a single-issue contributor, and we recognize that at times elected officials will back legislation we don't support or condone. However, it's important that we continue to engage in the political process and make our views known to policymakers and other stakeholders.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden in September announced that his administration would implement a Covid vaccine mandate that would cover private businesses with 100 or more workers. It will apply to about two-thirds of the private sector's workforce. The administration is expected to publish the rules soon.",

         "Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced the US Army Corps of Engineers and the state are putting up a 250-bed field hospital at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center in downtown Dallas during a press conference at the Texas State Capitol in Austin, Sunday, March 29, 2020.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday ordered the Legislature to reconvene for a third time to try to pass a Republican-backed voting restrictions bill that Democratic members blocked by leaving the state nearly a month ago.\n\nThe announcement, which had been expected, puts new pressure on the more than 50 Democratic lawmakers who left Texas for Washington, D.C., on July 12 and have remained there since. They had been preparing to celebrate running out the clock on the current 30-day special session that ends Friday, which would torpedo the sweeping elections overhaul for the second time since May.\n\nBut their holdout may not be over. Some Democrats said this week that they had no intention of returning to the state Capitol, even after they return to Texas and face possible arrest to compel their attendance.\n\nState Rep. Chris Turner, the leader of the House Democratic Caucus, would not say following Abbott's announcement whether they would return before the new session begins Saturday. But asked about members who say they will keep refusing to show up, Turner told The Associated Press: \"It's very much under discussion. I'll just leave it at that.\"\n\nAbbott, who is up for reelection in 2022, made a new elections package part of a 17-item agenda he instructed the GOP-led Legislature to consider over the next month. It includes other hot-button measures sought by conservative activists, including new border security measures and rules over how race is taught in public schools.\n\n\"I will continue to call special session after special session to reform our broken bail system, uphold election integrity, and pass other important items that Texans demand and deserve,\" Abbott said.\n\nThe cross-country exodus last month marked the second time that Democratic lawmakers staged a walkout on the voting overhaul, which they say would make it harder for young people, people of color and people with disabilities to vote. But like the first effort in May, there remains no clear path for Democrats to permanently block the voting measures or the other contentious GOP-backed proposals up for debate.\n\nBut Democratic state Rep. Eddie Rodriguez said Wednesday that there was enough will to keep trying.\n\n\"A vast majority, enough to break quorum, have committed to each other to not be in the Capitol when the second called session happens,\" Rodriguez said.\n\nAbbott last month vowed to arrest Democrats once they return to Texas.\n\n\"I don't think arresting Democrats and forcing them to the Statehouse, most of us being Hispanic or African American, or Asian American for that matter, that's not a good look,\" Rodriguez said. \"I would hope they would take that into account. But that's up to them. Again, we don't have a lot in our control.\"\n\nIn choosing to hunker down in Washington, the Democrats sought to put pressure on President Joe Biden and Congress to pass new federal voting rights legislation that would blunt the impact of the GOP bill in Texas. A group of key Democratic senators, including West Virginia's Joe Manchin, met Wednesday in Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's office to discuss a compromise on voting legislation.\n\nThe group's members have been working for weeks with their counterparts in the U.S. House to develop a narrower approach. But even with a retooled bill, they would still face the same challenge as before: a filibuster by Senate Republicans, who overwhelmingly oppose the measure. Overcoming that hurdle would require changes to Senate procedural rules, which many moderate Democrats oppose — denying the party the votes to change the rule.\n\nAlthough the Texas Democrats have met with Vice President Kamala Harris, a White House official said Biden had no plans to meet with them.",

Wade in 1973. President Joe Biden and others in his administration, as well as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., have vowed to take action after the Supreme Court refused to block the law from taking effect.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Abbott told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" that the new law and other politically divisive social issue laws will not make his state less appealing to businesses or individuals.\n\n\"You need to understand that there's a lot of businesses and a lot of Americans who like the social positions that the state of Texas is taking,\" Abbott said.",

         "Texas Gov. Abbott blames Covid spread on immigrants, criticizes Biden's 'Neanderthal' comment",
         "watch now\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday criticized President Joe Biden for calling his decisions to lift Covid-19 restrictions and mask mandates earlier this week \"Neanderthal thinking\" and blamed the state's ongoing outbreak on undocumented immigrants. Abbott's comments come after his widely criticized decision on Tuesday to rescind most of the state's Covid-19 restrictions, including a statewide mask mandate. Texas businesses will be allowed to open \"100%,\" effective March 10, he said. Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves made a similar move at roughly the same time. Biden on Wednesday slammed the governors for what he said was a \"big mistake\" and added that \"the last thing we need is Neanderthal thinking.\" Abbott told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that the comment was \"not the type of word that a president should be using\" and blamed the spread of the coronavirus on immigrants crossing the southern border. The Republican governor said the Biden administration has \"refused to test\" them for the virus.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"The Biden administration has been releasing immigrants in South Texas that have been exposing Texans to Covid. Some of those people have been put on buses, taking that Covid to other states in the United States,\" Abbott told CNBC. \"That is Neanderthal-type approach to dealing with the Covid situation.\" While the Republican governor didn't provide specifics, Telemundo reported on Tuesday that some migrants released by Border Patrol in the Texas city of Brownsville subsequently tested positive for Covid-19. Since the city began testing on Jan. 25, 108 migrants have tested positive for Covid-19, which is 6.3% of all those who took a test, according to the report. \"The Biden administration must stop importing Covid into our country,\" Abbott said. Top U.S. health officials have repeatedly urged states not to lift Covid-19 restrictions as nationwide coronavirus cases and deaths stall and highly transmissible variants threaten to \"hijack\" the recent decline in infections. However, Abbott defended his decision to lift the state's mask requirements, claiming that Texans already know that \"the safe standard, among other things, is to wear a mask.\" \"Do they really need the state to tell them what they already know for their own personal behavior?\" Abbott told CNBC. The governor added that the state's coronavirus infections are \"at four-month lows\" and Texas hospitals stand ready to treat an influx of patients if needed. Texas is reporting a daily average of roughly 7,265 new cases over the last week, a drop compared with the peak of more than 20,400 daily cases the state reported in January, according to a CNBC analysis of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nHowever, new infections have started to creep back up across the state, with average daily new cases growing by nearly 13% compared with a week ago. Abbott said most of the state's coronavirus spread over the holiday was driven by indoor gatherings, not by restaurants and other businesses. The newly lifted restrictions \"are not really that transformative\" because the state's mask mandate wasn't enforced and businesses were already at 75% capacity, he said. \"Maybe to people in New York it seems like this is a big difference,\" Abbott said. — CNBC's Will Feuer contributed to this report.",

         "FDA authorizes Abbott's rapid $25 Covid test for at-home use",
         "The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday announced that it has authorized Abbott Labs ' rapid Covid-19 test for at-home use, though doctors must prescribe the test for patients.\n\nThe test, which is an antigen test that delivers results in about 15 minutes, had previously been authorized for use by trained personnel only, but the new clearance will allow patients to test themselves at home with virtual assistance from a doctor. It's the third test authorized in the U.S. \"that can be used completely at home,\" Dr. Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement.\n\nTo deliver the test, which is called BinaxNOW and costs $25 for at-home use, to people's homes and to supervise the collection and testing process, Abbott said it has partnered with telehealth provider eMed. Patients collect the sample with a nasal swab themselves and an app helps guide the testing process and provide results, Abbott said.\n\nEveryone 15 years or older who are suspected of having Covid-19 by their health-care provider and is within the first seven days of symptom onset are eligible for the test, the FDA said. The test can also be used in people 4 years or older, though an adult needs to collect the sample, the agency said.\n\n\"FDA continues to authorize COVID-19 tests that will give more Americans access to greater testing flexibility and options,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said in a statement. \"The BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Home Test will have a significant manufacturing footprint with the potential to support testing for millions of people.\"\n\nAbbott said it expects to deliver 30 million at-home tests in the first quarter of 2021, with another 90 million in the second quarter. The FDA noted that antigen tests are not as accurate as many molecular tests.\n\n\"As the pandemic has evolved, the need for rapid testing has only grown. Unfortunately, we're still hearing that many people can't access testing as quickly as they need it,\" Robert Ford, Abbott's president and CEO, said in a statement. \"That's why Abbott is bringing our rapid BinaxNOW test and NAVICA platform into homes.\"\n\nThe FDA first authorized the test for use by trained personnel in August, touting it at the time as the first Covid-19 test that costs about $5 and delivers results in minutes on a testing card without lab equipment, similar to a pregnancy test. The U.S. quickly purchased 150 million of the tests for $750 million to expand testing capacity.\n\nHowever, at-home use of the test will cost $25, more than the $5 it costs in medical settings, Abbott said Wednesday.\n\n\"FDA's authorization of the BinaxNOW card test for home use means we should have tens of millions of COVID-19 tests in the coming months that Americans can use without leaving their home,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Wednesday in a statement.\n\nThe authorization comes after the FDA cleared Ellume's at-home Covid test on Tuesday. That product was authorized for use in anyone 2 years or older and does not require a prescription.",

He sits down with the CEO of cloud-based cybersecurity provider Zscaler to get an understanding of the competitive landscape.\n\nEye on the market: Ignore the Fed talk next week\n\nTwo conflicting forces are working to influence the market and the \"bad set\" happened to win out on Friday, CNBC's said.

The major averages all finished the session down less than 1% as it seemed unlikely the country would resume buying goods from American farmers. Looking past parts of the economy implicated in the U.S.-China trade war, employment is strong and domestic companies without Chinese exposure continue to have a positive impact, Cramer said. In the week ahead, the \"Mad Money\" host advised viewers not to pay attention to Federal Reserve reactions and to realize that the strong domestic economy and internationally-oriented economy are both balancing \"on a knife's edge.\" \"That's the right prism to use if you want to understand this market,\" he said.\n\nProjecting iPhone sales and the market's reaction\n\nA customer inspects two Apple iPhones at an Apple Store in Shanghai, China.

         "AbbVie deal may conclude a tumultuous 4 years for Botox-maker Allergan",
         "The company's leadership has come under pressure from activist investor from David Tepper for management changes. Shareholders have been calling for Allergan to split or sell the company.\n\nAllergan, the maker of Botox and blockbuster eye treatment Restatis, isn't the same industry leader it once was. The stock has lost about half its value since 2017. The drugmaker has struggled ever since its planned $160 billion mega deal with Pfizer fell through in 2016 after pushback from the Obama administration, analysts say. The pharmaceutical company has also been hit with drug trial setbacks and generic competition.\n\nAt the time, Allergan was selling its generic drug business to Israel drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical for $40.5 billion. The cash and stock deal, announced in July 2015, was seen by investors as a positive for the Ireland-based pharmaceutical company. It freed Allergan to focus on more bankable brand-name drugs, while also providing it with more cash to pay down debt. Allergan is \"trying to move higher up into the food chain, so they'll probably go after a branded drug company,\" Cooperman, the Omega Advisors chairman and CEO, told CNBC in an interview on July 28, 2015 . \"Maybe AbbVie.\"\n\n\"Investors have been frustrated,\" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Randall Stanicky, who has been calling for a break up Allergan since 2017. He said a combination of drug trial setbacks, disappointments with capital deployment, strategic missteps and the company's inability to grow earnings has pressured the stock.\n\nNow, Allergan's fortunes may change. AbbVie announced Tuesday it would buy Allergan for about $63 billion, a 45% premium over Allergan's closing share price of $129.57 on Monday. According to the deal, Allergan shareholders will receive 0.866 AbbiVie share and $120.30 in cash for each Allergan share for a total value of $188.24 a share. If approved, the deal would combine two struggling companies seeking growth.\n\nStanicky said the deal is a \"nice exit from a tough situation\" for Allergan. \"I think investors should be happy with this exit,\" he added.\n\nAllergan investors cheered the deal Tuesday. Shares of Allergan surged 25.4% on Tuesday while AbbVie shares fell 16.3%.\n\nAbbVie has been looking to diversify its portfolio as blockbuster arthritis treatment Humira faces competition from cheaper versions in Europe and faces expiration of its patents in the U.S. in 2023. Allergan's aesthetics products and eye care and other medicines could help AbbVie shore up revenue.\n\nDavid Maris, a research analyst at Wells Fargo who covers Allergan, told CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Tuesday that he isn't convinced that the deal is a better long-term alternative for Allergan shareholders looking past Humira's patent expiration. But in a follow-up phone interview, Maris added that the stock had been underpeforming for so long, the board had to do something.\n\nThe deal is a \"little disappointing,\" Maris said.\" \"I can see why AbbVie wants to diversify away from Humira. I don't know why an Allergan shareholder would want to diversify into Humaria.\"\n\nJefferies health-care desk analyst Jared Holz said AbbVie's stock decline is a \"bit overdone,\" saying this solves a growth problem for each company. \"I feel like I'm the only person in the world who feels this deal isn't a disaster,\" he said. \"It is a homerun for Allergan shareholders.\"",

         "AbbVie shares fell almost 3 percent on Tuesday after the California Department of Insurance sued the pharmaceutical company for allegedly giving health-care providers kickbacks for prescribing its arthritis drug Humira.\n\nThe suit alleges that AbbVie provided cash, trips and other gifts to health-care providers as incentives to prescribe the drug. The company allegedly also provided additional professional services, such as free insurance processing and marketing assistance.\n\nThe scheme was pulled off by a group of registered nurses known as Abbvie Nurse Ambassadors, who are sent into patients' homes after they are prescribed Humira and were trained to downplay potential risks of the drug, according to the suit.\n\nThe company \"only provides the Ambassadors as long as the physicians continue to prescribe AbbVie's drug instead of selecting another course of treatment,\" according to the California Department of Insurance.\n\nAbbVie spokeswoman Adelle Infante said in a statement that the allegations had no merit.\n\n\"AbbVie provides a number of support services for patients, once they are prescribed Humira, that both educate and assist patients with their therapy, including nursing support, and these resources are beneficial to patients dealing with a chronic condition,\" Infante said. \"They in no way replace or interfere with interactions between patients and their healthcare providers.\"\n\nThe allegations were brought to the attention of the department by Lazaro Suarez, who was employed as an AbbVie Nurse Ambassador in Florida.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, private insurers have paid out $1.2 billion in pharmacy claims for Humira, which would make the case the largest instance of insurance fraud in the history of the California regulator.",

         "Richard Gonzalez, chairman and chief executive officer of AbbVie Inc., listens during a Senate Finance Committee hearing on drug pricing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, Feb. 26, 2019.\n\nHumira sales are one of the company's four main financial targets — along with net revenues, operating margin and return on assets — that accounted for 60 percent of Gonzalez's short-term incentive plan. The plan pays out a cash award for each of the top five executives equal to up to 200 percent of their base salary, depending on if they meet the targets and other performance measures.\n\nHumira's $18.3 billion in 2017 sales — which rose 14.6 percent from the previous year and accounted for about 65 percent of the company's $28.1 billion in revenue — were a major factor in calculating the compensation for AbbVie's top executives last year, according to the company's most recent compensation data.\n\nA Senate panel grilled AbbVie Chairman and CEO Richard Gonzalez about tying executive bonuses to sales of the U.S. drugmaker's blockbuster arthritis treatment Humira.\n\nThe company hit its internal target for Humira sales last year, helping its top five executives to nearly max out their cash bonuses with a payout equal to 175 percent of their annual base pay, the company said.\n\n\"In 2017 all financial and strategic goals were materially achieved, resulting in performance scores between 99% and 100% of target,\" the company said.\n\nGonzalez, 64, made a total of $22.6 million for his performance in 2017, $4.3 million of which was his cash bonus. The rest of his compensation was base salary and a mix of stock, restricted shares and options.\n\n\"This strikes me as problematic,\" Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in questioning the CEO at a hearing on prescription drug costs before the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday. \"Would you make a smaller bonus if you dropped the price of Humira?\"\n\nIn response, Gonzalez said, \"Humira was one element of a set of financial factors that were evaluated as part of my compensation. It's obviously a very significant product for us. So it is clear it would be a part of the evaluation.\"\n\nWyden snapped back with, \"I'd like that in writing. It looks to me you'd be making a smaller bonus if you dropped the price of Humira. I'd like that in writing within 10 days.\"\n\nSince 2014, AbbVie has nearly doubled the price of its top-selling drug Humira, which is used to treat diseases including arthritis, plaque psoriasis and Crohn's, according to a review of data provided by Rx Savings Solutions. The drug now carries a list price of more than $60,000 per year.\n\nAbbVie has been aggressive in keeping cheaper copycat versions of its drug off the U.S. market. The company is not expected to face biosimilar competition in the U.S. until 2023.\n\nThe drug's list price and patent faced the brunt of the heat from senators at the hearing. At one point, Wyden likened AbbVie's patent practices to Gollum, the slimy \"Lord of the Rings\" character who coveted the ring of power.\n\n\"Can the patients opt for a less expensive alternative? They can't, because AbbVie protects the exclusivity of Humira like Gollum with his ring. Thick cobwebs of patents and shadowy deals with drugmakers, all of them are in place to keep the cash flowing,\" Wyden said.\n\nGonzalez argued the drug has so many patents because it's used to treat several different ailments.\n\nWATCH: Lawmakers grill pharma execs over high drug costs",

         "Humira, the injectable rheumatoid arthritis treatment is pictured in a pharmacy in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nAbbvie said on Thursday it settled all patent disputes with Novartis , granting it a non-exclusive license to manufacture and sell a copycat version of blockbuster drug, Humira.\n\nAbbvie, however, did not disclose details regarding the royalties it will receive from Novartis generics unit, Sandoz, as part of the agreement.\n\nShares of Abbvie rose 2.39 percent to $92.87 in after-market trading.\n\nThe license period will begin on Sept. 30, 2023 in the United States and on Oct. 16 in most countries in the European Union, Abbvie said in a statement.\n\nSandoz received marketing approval for its Humira biosimilar from the European Commission in July and had submitted its application to the U.S. health regulator early this year.\n\nLast year, Abbvie reached a settlement with Amgen Inc , delaying Amgen's cheaper biosimilar version of Humira until Jan. 31, 2023.\n\nHumira is the world's best-selling prescription medicine and has long buoyed AbbVie's business, raking in $5.19 billion in second-quarter sales.\n\nBut as cheaper biosimilar versions come closer to entering the market, the company has been trying to grow sales from its other medicines, including cancer treatment Imbruvica.",

         "A screen displays the share price for pharmaceutical maker AbbVie on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved AbbVie 's new treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, a win for the drugmaker seeking to widen its portfolio as its blockbuster flagship therapy Humira faces competition.\n\nThe drug, Rinvoq, also called upadacitinib, belongs to a class of drugs known as JAK inhibitors that block inflammation-causing enzymes called Janus kinases.\n\nIt is set to compete with Pfizer 's Xeljanz and Eli Lilly 's Olumiant.\n\nRinvoq's label has a warning that flags risks of serious infections and lymphoma. In a notice, the FDA also said that patients taking JAK inhibitors in general risked developing blood clots.\n\nAbbVie has been aggressively fending off competition for Humira by signing deals with rival companies to prevent their cheap versions of the drug from entering the United States, its biggest market, until 2023.\n\nHumira, which treats rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, is the world's best-selling medicine, and brought in global revenue of $4.87 billion in the second quarter, but sales have been falling as it faces competition from cheaper rivals in Europe.\n\nTo further diversify its pipeline, AbbVie in June announced a deal to buy Botox-maker Allergan for $63 billion.\n\nIt has also launched a new psoriasis medicine, Skyrizi, to help retain some market share.\n\nShares of the company rose 2.2% to $64.36 in early afternoon trade.",

         "Take a look at some of the biggest movers in the premarket:\n\nAccenture (ACN) – The consulting firm reported quarterly profit of $1.70 per share, falling 3 cents a share short of Wall Street forecasts. Revenue also came in slightly shy of estimates and the company gave a weaker-than-expected current-quarter revenue forecast, as clients spend less due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nE.W. Scripps (SSP) – Scripps announced a deal buy privately held TV network operator ION Media for $2.65 billion. The deal is being backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), with Berkshire making a $600 million preferred equity investment in Scripps to help finance the purchase.\n\nBlackBerry (BB) – The software company beat estimates by 9 cents a share, with quarterly earnings of 11 cents per share. Revenue was also above expectations, on strong demand for its security and car software.\n\nCarMax (KMX) – The used-vehicle retailer earned $1.79 per share for its latest quarter, well above the consensus estimate of $1.08 a share. Revenue was also above analysts' forecasts. CarMax saw vehicle sales rise by 3.9%, with comparable-store sales up 1.2%, and its financing profit increased by 29%.\n\nDarden Restaurants (DRI) – The parent of Olive Garden and other restaurant chains earned 28 cents per share for its latest quarter, beating the consensus estimate of 5 cents a share. Revenue was very slightly below Street forecasts with sales during the quarter at about 82% of prior-year levels.

Revenue came in above forecasts as well.

Revenue was also above estimates, with strength in both the retail pharmacy and pharmacy services segments.\n\nUnitedHealth (UNH) – The health insurer is in advanced talks to buy online pharmacy startup DivvyDose, according to a Bloomberg report. The proposed deal is said to be worth about $300 million, according to people familiar with the matter, although nothing has been finalized.\n\nNikola (NKLA) – Nathan Anderson, head of short-selling firm Hindenburg Research, told The Wall Street Journal that more bad news will emerge about the electric truck maker Nikola. Hindenburg recently released a report about a series of improprieties at Nikola, which has hit the stock hard even as Nikola calls the report \"false and misleading.\"\n\nDollar Tree (DLTR) – Dollar Tree is resuming its stock buyback program, after suspending it in March due to the pandemic. The discount retailer has roughly $800 million in buyback authorization remaining under that program.\n\nH.B.

         "2 AI beneficiaries that haven't caught up yet, according to top value investor",
         "Artificial intelligence-adjacent stocks have been the clear leaders of this bull rally, but there may still be some potential beneficiaries of the trend that haven't caught up yet, according to Aaron Dunn. While some investors have voiced their concerns over lofty valuations, Dunn, the co-head of value equity at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a portfolio manager on the Eaton Vance Value team, told CNBC in a recent interview that he's been keeping an eye on Micron and Accenture . Both stocks represent businesses with good returns, he said. Micron benefits from the consolidation of the memory business, while Accenture is capital light. Accenture is profitable, while Micron is not too far behind. Dunn believes that semiconductor manufacturer Micron could benefit as demand for memory chips begins to outpace supply once again. \"With AI, you need more memory,\" he said. \"I think we're going to go back to a period where memory is tight, and Micron has really good new technology that's also going to soak up excess capacity.\" In February, the firm announced that it had started production of its HBM3E, or High Bandwidth Memory wafer. These chips would be comparable with Nvidia's graphic processing units for AI capabilities, while also requiring less power and acting at higher speeds, Dunn said. Meanwhile, Micron could also be a beneficiary of the U.S.'s desire to have more of a domestic presence in the semiconductor chip market. \"Effectively, MU will be getting paid by the U.S. government to build in-country capacity,\" Dunn said. Shares of Micron have rallied 9% so far this year, but Nvidia has gained 77% over the same time period. The portfolio manger cautioned that while Micron shares have had a big runup — it's gained 77% since hitting a 52-week low last March — and may be at risk of a modest pullback, the stock's long-term fundamentals look to be very strong. MU 6M mountain MU 6-month chart Dunn also listed professional services firm Accenture as a potential AI beneficiary. Shares have added 7% so far this year, as of Friday's close. Accenture is likely to rally as firms begin to adopt AI and large language learning models into their business operations, Dunn said. \"Businesses will need help in understanding how AI should be used and the eventual implementation of those technologies,\" he said. \"Accenture is positioned to provide this. This is likely an inflection point for them that will define the intermediate trends for them.\" ACN 6M mountain ACN 6-month chart Dunn's fund, Eaton Vance's Focused Value Opportunities Fund , has underperformed its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Value Index , so far this year. Since 2014, the fund has outperformed its benchmark in five of the past nine years. It has an expense ratio of 1.04% and a neutral rating from Morningstar, which is partly attributed to its fee structure.",

So in a way, he had made it, and then lost everything.\n\n“I was starting from scratch (again),” said Roytman, now senior managing director of Accenture Interactive across Europe, Africa and Latin America (EALA).\n\nHe told CNBC’s Karen Tso on an episode of “What Drives You” how he had to find a new job and pick himself back up.\n\n“I joined Digitas — Digitas is an agency in the States. I was with them for six years until Publicis bought them. Then I decided to go and look for different types of companies where we could combine technology and creativity,” he said.",

         "A view of the exterior of the new Dutch head office of international technology company 3M in Delft, Netherlands, November 5, 2014.\n\nCheck out the companies making headlines in midday trading.\n\nPalo Alto Networks — The cybersecurity stock jumped more than 4% after S&P Dow Jones Indices announced Friday postmarket it will replace Dish Network in the S&P 500, effective June 20. Dish Network dipped about 1%.\n\n3M — The industrial manufacturer's shares slid 3% after the judge in the company's multidistrict litigation over so-called forever chemicals agreed to delay the first trial three weeks so parties can finalize a settlement of claims with municipal water providers, Bloomberg reported Monday.\n\nCoinbase — Shares of the crypto exchange and services company tumbled 10% after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued crypto exchange Binance on Monday, alleging Binance and its co-founder Changpeng Zhao commingled billions of dollars of investor funds with their own and violated securities laws.\n\nEPAM Systems — Shares of the software engineering firm tumbled 18% after it cut guidance amid further deterioration in near-term demand.

         "3M announced Tuesday it will spin off its health-care business into a separate publicly traded company.\n\nThe new business will focus on wound and oral care, health-care IT and biopharma filtration, the material science company said in a release. That includes products like its bandages, skin adhesives, oral aligners, air purifiers and optical lenses.\n\nThe company's health-care products also include the Bair Hugger surgical warming system, which is currently the subject of nearly 6,000 lawsuits. 3M maintains that the product has no relation to surgical-site infections.\n\n3M health-care products recorded more than $8 billion in sales in 2021. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of next year, and 3M will maintain a 19.9% stake in the new company.\n\nThe announcement comes as 3M said its second-quarter revenue fell nearly 3% to $8.7 billion. Net income dropped to $78 million from $1.5 billion a year earlier, including a $1.2 billion pretax charge tied to resolving litigation related to Combat Arms Earplugs.\n\nThe company said Aearo Technologies, its subsidiary that produces Combat Arms Earplugs, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings to establish a trust to resolve all legal claims related to the product. 3M said it believe the earplugs were safe and effective when used properly, but that they nevertheless face increasing litigation.\n\nAfter excluding that one-time charge, 3M earned $2.48 per share. The performance topped expectations. According to Refinitv, analysts expected 3M to earn $2.42 per share on revenue of $8.58 billion.\n\nShares of the company closed up 5% at $140.82.\n\n3M is also simultaneously spinning off its food safety business. That branch will merge with Neogen and is expected to be divested by September.\n\n— Reuters contributed to this report.",

         "3M must face more than 230,000 lawsuits accusing it of selling defective earplugs to the U.S. military, after a U.S. judge on Friday ruled that the bankruptcy of a subsidiary did not stop lawsuits against the non-bankrupt parent company.\n\nCompanies that file for bankruptcy typically receive an immediate reprieve from lawsuits, and 3M subsidiary Aearo Technologies LLC argued that extending those protections to 3M would buy Aearo time to address its debts and restructuring goals.\n\nAearo and 3M had argued that bankruptcy offered a faster and fairer way to compensate veterans who say that earplugs made by Aearo caused hearing loss.\n\nBut bankruptcy Judge Jeffrey J. Graham in Indianapolis said that Aearo's bankruptcy restructuring could proceed in parallel with the lawsuits.\n\nWhile the \"sheer size\" of the consolidated litigation may have spurred 3M and Aearo to seek \"additional leverage\" through the bankruptcy proceedings, that did not create a legal need to protect 3M, Graham ruled.\n\nAttorneys representing the veterans with hearing loss said they looked forward to continuing their lawsuits against 3M in other courts.\n\n\"Judge Graham's decision is a complete rejection of 3M's attempt to evade accountability and hide in bankruptcy after multiple juries found it liable for knowingly causing hearing damage to those who served our nation,\" plaintiff attorneys Bryan Aylstock and Christopher Seeger said in a statement.\n\nA spokesman for 3M said it intended to appeal. 3M has set aside $1 billion to settle the earplug litigation.\n\n\"Continuing to litigate these cases one-by-one over the coming years will not provide certainty or fairness for any party,\" 3M spokesman Sean Lynch said.\n\n3M subsidiary Aearo Technologies LLC filed for bankruptcy protection in Indiana on July 26, seeking to resolve lawsuits alleging that 3M's Combat Arms Earplugs Version 2 (CAEv2) caused hearing loss.\n\nThe lawsuits have been consolidated in federal court in Florida and have grown into the largest mass tort litigation in U.S. history. Aearo placed $1 billion in a trust to settle them and agreed to indemnify 3M for all liability related to CAEv2.\n\n3M has denied liability, saying its earplugs offered protection to soldiers while allowing them to hear on the battlefield.\n\n",

         "Neogen CEO John Adent on Wednesday touted the company's deal to merge with 3M 's food-safety unit, telling CNBC's Jim Cramer it improves revenue growth opportunities and fuels innovation on emerging technologies such as the blockchain.\n\nNeogen — which makes animal health-care products and food safety tests, including those that can be used to detect pathogens and allergens — announced merger plans Tuesday. The news sent the Michigan-based company's stock higher by 8.2% Tuesday, although it gave back some of those gains Wednesday when it lost 1.34%.\n\nCombining with 3M's food-safety unit \"doubles the size of our business,\" Adent said in an interview on \"Mad Money.\" \"It really allows us to reach more customers more often with an unparalleled product offering. ... It's going to help us drive this industry forward through our data analytics platform and our blockchain solution that really increases the efficiency, traceability and enhance the food-safety protocols for customers.\"\n\nBlockchains are decentralized digital ledgers that are most commonly associated with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether. However, that's not its only use case.\n\nNeogen partnered with Ripe Technology nearly two years ago to start adapting the blockchain into its work on food safety diagnostics and animal genomics. The blockchain is helpful to Neogen because it \"permanently connects a tremendous amount of potentially critical data,\" Adent said in a release at the time.\n\nOn Wednesday, he further elaborated on how Neogen uses blockchain technology for food safety.\n\n\"When you go to the store and buy one of our customers' steaks and you take it home, if you send me a sample, I'm going to be able to tell you where that animal lived, what that animal ate, all the inputs into that animal, every single stop along the way until it got to your dinner plate,\" Adent told Cramer.",

         "The market appears to be underestimating the hit 3M is going to take from ongoing lawsuits, creating downside risk for investors, according to Morgan Stanley. Analyst Joshua Pokrzywinski downgraded the stock to underweight from equal weight, saying in a note to clients that the company's fundamentals would struggle to overcome the hit from lawsuits over an ear protection product and the use of chemicals known as PFAS. \"Our analysis of Combat Arms implies that the market's estimate of PFAS has declined (despite negative news flow) or that valuation of the core business is too high,\" Pokrzywinski said. \"While we see the fundamental picture improving through price/cost, overall organic growth remains cloudy as priority platforms are muted by a large, stable portfolio that struggles to outgrow IP given its sheer size and global ubiquity.\" Morgan Stanley cut its price target for 3M to $150 per share from $185. The stock closed at $154.14 on Wednesday. Shares were off 1.9% in premarket trading Thursday. 3M has been named in thousands of lawsuits over its Combat Arms earplug product, which it discontinued in 2015, according to 3M. For the perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, lawsuits, 3M has already logged hundreds of millions of dollars in pretax charges and could have to take more hits in the future. At the same time, 3M has seen its sales and earnings grow at a slower rate than its peers in recent years, Morgan Stanley said. \"In other words, after taking into account weaker fundamental performance we think the market appears to be understating the combined liabilities from Combat Arms and PFAS by ~$15B,\" the analyst said. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.\n\nTraders work under monitors displaying 3M Co. signage on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York.

         "My top 8 things to watch Wednesday, Jan. 25 1. Microsoft (MSFT) shares sink nearly 3% early Wednesday, pressuring the broader market after the Dow Jones Industrial Average , the S & P 500 and the Nasdaq . Microsoft's fiscal second-quarter earnings beat estimates. Revenue missed. Guidance short. CEO Satya Nadella excited about OpenAI's ChatGPT. But CFO Amy Hood plays grim reaper halfway through the call. Maturing tech. MUST WAIT UNTIL AMY. Only thing that matters. Azure cloud sales up 38% year over year in constant currency. Lots of price target cuts by Wall Street analysts, but they largely keep their buy ratings. The Club has MSFT at our 2 rating , meaning we'd like to see more pullback before considering buying more. 2. 3M (MMM) was bad. I mean terrible on every line item for the quarter. Full-year sales decline of 2% to 6%, worse than estimates at the midpoint. You have to wonder what the heck management is going to do besides come up with a new kind of scotch tape. Multiple PT cuts on the Street. The industrial giant announces 2,500 manufacturing job cuts . 3. Boeing (BA) reports big fourth-quarter loss. Supply chain snarls outweigh surging travel demand as the world learns to live with Covid. Aircraft manufacturing suffered during the height of the pandemic. Revenue of $19.98 billion fell short of estimates. Reaffirms guidance on Max and Dreamliner. Positive annual free cash flow. 4. AT & T (T) fourth-quarter earnings beat but revenue misses. Not great but better than Verizon (VZ). Full-year guidance free cash flow of $16 billion or better versus $16.2 billion expected. FCF in 2022 was $14.1 billion. Increase in subscribers but annual profit outlook below expectations. 5. JPMorgan cuts Ford (F) price target to $15 per share from $16 and General Motors (GM) PT to $57 from $59; keeps overweight (buy) ratings on both. Analysts at JPMorgan also cut Tesla (TSLA) price target to $120 from $125; keep underweight (sell) rating. Tesla shares bounce 16% year to date but still down over 53% over the past 12 months. Elon Musk's electric vehicle maker is set to report quarterly results after the closing bell Wednesday. 6. Baird keeps Danaher (DHR) at an overweight (buy) rating but cuts price target to $309 per share from $321. Analysts say the life sciences and medical diagnostics company now derisked from Covid. We saw Tuesday's DHR stock drop after largely solid quarterly results was a buying opportunity. 7. Barclays raises price target on SLB (SLB) to $74 per share from $62. Already in the stock? That's the question with all oil and gas companies. I say no. We had the nation's strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) being emptied, and there's no shortage of places that are being drilled. Instead of SLB, we own oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL), which reported a strong quarter Tuesday. 8. Bank of America (BAC) gives employees who make up to $500,000 a year restricted stock. In a memo to staff, CEO Brian Moynihan said the bank is investing its people \"at a time of change in the global economy.\" (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long MSFT, F, DHR, HAL.

We saw Tuesday's DHR stock drop after largely solid quarterly results was a buying opportunity. 7. Barclays raises price target on SLB (SLB) to $74 per share from $62. Already in the stock? That's the question with all oil and gas companies. I say no. We had the nation's strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) being emptied, and there's no shortage of places that are being drilled. Instead of SLB, we own oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL), which reported a strong quarter Tuesday. 8. Bank of America (BAC) gives employees who make up to $500,000 a year restricted stock. In a memo to staff, CEO Brian Moynihan said the bank is investing its people \"at a time of change in the global economy.\" (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long MSFT, F, DHR, HAL.

         "It will be a tough road for 3M before its stock can catch up to the broader market, according to RBC Capital Markets. Analyst Deane Dray downgraded 3M to underperform from sector perform, saying in a note to clients Tuesday night that the company had little upside for the foreseeable future. \"We are downgrading MMM from Sector Perform to Underperform as the company faces mounting operating and legal challenges in 2022. Ongoing inflation/supply chain pressures have exposed fundamental weaknesses in 3M's price/cost actions that are unlikely to be remedied soon,\" Dray wrote. Shares of the industrial company underperformed the broader market in 2021 and are still trading near pre-pandemic levels, compared to a roughly 40% gain for the S & P 500. RBC slashed its price target to $166 per share from $199. The new target is nearly 8% below where the stock closed on Tuesday. Shares fell 1% in premarket trading Wednesday. On the legal front, 3M is facing challenges in multiple areas related to its use of a class of chemical substances known as PFAS. The company's \"litigation outlook will get much worse before it gets better,\" according to RBC. \"Along with headline risk, we believe 3M will likely have to take more legal reserves to address its mounting PFAS and military hearing-loss litigation,\" the note said. -CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.\n\nTraders work under monitors displaying 3M Co. signage on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York.

         "With I.P.O.’s on the rise, analysts get new scrutiny",
         "Read more from The New York Times:\n\nBlackBerry to explore its strategic alternatives, including a sale\n\nCampbell Soup to sell some European operations\n\nDole's chief to buy out company for $13.50 a share\n\nInterviewing analysts as part of the process of going public has become more prevalent, several analysts said, with the proliferation of so-called I.P.O. advisers, firms that advise companies in the early stages of an offering. These firms are paid to help companies and, often, their private equity owners screen banks vying to take companies public. Among other things, they arrange for meetings between companies and the Wall Street analysts and bankers.\n\n\"If you are going to see the people who are screening the underwriters you are there for one purpose, to win banking business,\" said another Wall Street analyst, who also requested anonymity because his company prohibits employees from speaking to the media without prior approval. This analyst said he knew of the practice but had not taken part in any meetings.\n\nParticipants say company meetings with the analysts and bankers are held separately, but can happen within hours of each other, and banks rarely send compliance officers to monitor the discussions. Analysts say that when private equity executives are involved, the sessions can turn especially uncomfortable, veering into questions about a company's valuation.\n\nSolebury Capital, Rothschild and Lazard are among the leading firms in this area. Solebury has recently guided a number of companies through the I.P.O. process, including the discount retailer Five Below; Bloomin' Brands, which owns Outback Steakhouse and Bonefish Grill; and HD Supply Holdings, according to regulatory filings.\n\nIn an interview, Solebury's co-chief executives, Alan Sheriff and Ted Hatfield, said that their corporate clients meet with analysts as well as bankers as they work through the offering process, but that the meetings with analysts are \"informational,\" regarding general market trends.\n\n\"Pitching investment banking in analyst meetings is strictly off limits,\" Mr. Sheriff said.\n\n\n\n(Read more: Hot IPO Cvent praises JOBS Act, talks disruption)\n\nA senior research executive at one major Wall Street firm says he thinks it is acceptable for an analyst to have a broad chat with a company looking to go public, and the analyst can benefit from that meeting by learning more about the industry. But he expressed concern about meetings with companies in the process of choosing banks to underwrite their I.P.O.'s.\n\n\"I am not O.K. with a third party organizing a beauty contest with the express purpose of winning banking business,\" said the executive, whose firm has a policy against speaking to the media. \"The problem is, the analyst going to the meeting knows the purpose and couldn't help but feel pressured. You are selling your bank.\"\n\nInvestors both large and small often rely on the recommendations of analysts, who issue buy and sell recommendations on stocks. Questions about the legitimacy of Wall Street research came into focus during the height of the Internet and telecommunications bubble. During that heady time, analysts worked closely with banking colleagues to secure profitable I.P.O. assignments from fast-growing tech companies.\n\nMr. Spitzer, as attorney general, spearheaded an investigation that helped solidify his reputation at the time as the \"sheriff of Wall Street.\" He released incriminating e-mails that showed analysts privately disparaged the very companies they were publicly telling investors to buy. They also showed how influential investment bankers were in securing positive research reports for companies that were either clients of a firm or prospective customers.\n\nIn one e-mail, an investor asked Henry Blodget, then a Merrill Lynch analyst, what was so interesting about GoTo.com, an Internet company he was recommending, except for the banking fees that it generated.\n\n\n\n(Read more: Seeking capital, some companies turn to 'do-it-yourself I.P.O.'s')\n\n\"Nothing,\" Mr. Blodget replied.\n\nIn another e-mail message, Mr. Blodget called InfoSpace, an Internet company that he favored publicly, \"a piece of junk.\"\n\nFederal regulators barred Mr. Blodget, who now runs Business Insider, a business news Web site, and Jack B. Grubman, another prominent analyst who worked at Salomon Smith Barney, from the securities industry.\n\nIn 2003, 10 Wall Street banks agreed to pay a collective $1.4 billion to resolve the government's accusations. As part of the settlement, the firms agreed to separate their banking and research departments, a move that regulators said would ensure that analysts operated more autonomously.\n\nAnalysts were also expressly \"prohibited from participating in efforts to solicit investment banking business,\" including pitches and road shows. Over the years, that language has been incorporated into rules policed by Finra, the regulator.",

         "A Wild Night of Surprises at the NFL Draft 9:10 AM ET Fri, 26 April 2013\n\nAll of those forces resulted in the once-unthinkable on Thursday night: He was not even chosen in the first round. That's right—32 teams had the chance to select him, and 32 teams said \"no thank you.\"\n\n\n\nAnd he lost millions of dollars.\n\n\n\n(Read More: New Facebook Tool, Te'o Scandal Fan Flames of Privacy Debate)\n\nLook at it this way: If an NFL team picked Te'o at No. 5, he would have received a contract in the vicinity of four years and $20 million, with roughly half of that guaranteed. The millions from a rookie contract likely would have been matched by off-field endorsements.\n\n\n\nNone of that has materialized, and now he's looking at a contract that will pay him about half a million with, perhaps, $2 million guaranteed.\n\n\n\nThat's a net loss of at least $8 million.\n\n\n\n\"Even if he plays 10 years in the league, this is millions over the first four years that he never gets back,\" said sports economist Patrick Rishe. \"His endorsement value took an even bigger hit.\"\n\n\n\n\"Here's a guy who was a hot commodity during his senior year at Notre Dame,\" he said. \"If he performs well in the national championship game, if there isn't a story about the hoax girlfriend, and he had performed well at the combines, not only is he going to be picked in the top 10 and earn more money, but he's going to be more likely to get the endorsement deals.\"\n\n\n\n(Read More: Get a Fake Facebook Girlfriend for $20)\n\nTe'o must have known there was a possibility that he would not be picked because he did not attend the Radio City festivities at all Thursday night, avoiding the awkward possibility of multiple camera shots of him waiting in the green room as team after team passed him by.\n\n\n\nThat's what happened to West Virginia quarterback Geno Smith, and he was so upset that he declined all interviews afterward.\n\n\n\nSmith was projected as the top quarterback in the draft, but there was only one QB picked in the first round. His name was EJ Manuel and not Geno Smith.\n\n\n\nAs for Te'o, he assuredly will get drafted at some point.\n\n\n\nThe rest is up to him.\n\n\n\n\"If he plays and performs well, if he's a marketable player, if he's great in the community, all of those (other) things get washed away,\" Rishe said.\n\n\n\nBut as you just saw, that is a lot of \"ifs.\"",

         "Replacing O'Neal: Who Waits in The Wings?",
         "If Merrill Lynch Chief Executive Stan O'Neal is forced out, there's little doubt who the firm's army of more than 16,000 brokers would like to see replace him: their own boss.\n\nRobert McCann, president of Merrill Lynch's global private client business, has emerged as a potential candidate to replace the embattled O'Neal. Other candidates include BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink and NYSE Euronext CEO John Thain as possible replacements.\n\nO'Neal's grip on Merrill has weakened after the company posted its biggest quarterly loss in its history. O'Neal admitted this week he and his team misjudged the company's exposure to subprime mortgages, triggering an $8.4 billion write-down in the third quarter.\n\nMcCann looked to have been sidelined just a few months ago after his direct reporting line to O'Neal was severed. But now he's making a comeback.\n\n\"If naming your CEO was a popularity contest, Stan would be out and McCann would be in. But we know it doesn't work that way,\" said a Merrill Lynch executive, who declined to be named.\n\nIt's unclear if McCann has enough recognition among Merrill Board members, a group put together during O'Neal's tenure.\n\nBut Tom Sowanick, chief investment officer of Clearbrook Financial in Princeton, N.J., said McCann has the experience and leadership skills to run Merrill. Sowanick, a former Merrill Lynch wealth management strategist, worked for McCann before leaving the company.\n\n\"Bob is a very demanding yet capable leader. He will be able to shepherd Merrill Lynch out of this storm,\" Sowanick said.\n\nFink's candidacy has gathered steam because he is considered one of the top U.S. bond managers. He also is seen as someone who can remedy Merrill Lynch's fixed-income problems.\n\nThain has a blue-chip Wall Street resume, with credentials sharpened by running NYSE and his time as a former co-president at Goldman Sachs.\n\nA spokeswoman for BlackRock, an asset manager in which Merrill holds a large stake, declined to comment, saying the company does not comment on market speculation and rumors. NYSE spokesmen were not immediately available to comment.\n\nMerrill's retail brokers have already lost confidence in O'Neal, thanks to the massive writedowns that happened on his watch. And some brokers are nervous that Merrill could be an attractive takeover target for a foreign bank. The company's depressed stock price and nearly $2 trillion in client assets might spur action from bidders.\n\nDeutsche Bank analyst Mike Mayo said Merrill could fetch $100 to $120 a share in a takeover. That's a 90 percent premium over the company's current trading price.\n\nA report in the New York Times Friday said O'Neal directed investment bank head Greg Fleming to approach Wachovia about a merger. Dick Bove, an analyst at Punk Ziegel & Co., said the overture \"may indicate some panic on Mr. O'Neal's part.\"\n\nMany investors share the brokers' feelings about O'Neal, who the Times said has also angered the board by authorizing the Wachovia talks without consulting with it.\n\nMerrill Lynch declined comment for this story.\n\n\"We're clearly disappointed in Stan O'Neal...\" one of Merrill's largest investors said on condition of anonymity.\n\nCNBC learned on Friday that O'Neal had conceded to friends he could be out of a job by the end of the weekend.",

         "When the NBA needed something to spice up its All-Star Saturday night — as the Slam Dunk Contest (since 1984) and the three-point contest (since 1986) got stale — they unveiled the Skills Challenge in 2003.\n\nWhat they should have done was unveiled the game of H-O-R-S-E. The league will realize this when the game is played by Kevin Durant, Joe Johnson and O.J. Mayo on TNT's lead-up to Saturday night's festivities. The idea was dreamed up by the network to create some action around \"Inside the NBA,\" which will be set up outside US Airways Arena and will broadcast live with Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith and Chris Webber from 5 to 7 p.m. ET on Saturday night.\n\nIt's easy to see why this is going to be popular. As someone who has seen pros play a game of horse, or something close to it, it's really exciting. They'll play on a 45-by-50 foot court, where something called the NBA All-Star Block Party is being held. They'll wear microphones so you can hear them call every shot and there is, of course, no dunking allowed.\n\n\"Everyone played H-O-R-S-E as a kid,\" said Jon Diament, executive vice president of ad sales and marketing for Turner. \"Who has played slam dunk?\"\n\nExcept, and you might have heard this, the guys aren't playing H-O-R-S-E. They are actually playing G-E-I-C-O, thanks to the insurance company paying a premium for the name change. They'll also get scoreboard signage and on-air graphics and probably get an incredible bang for the buck.\n\nThe only thing we can think of that we thought Geico should have done was to pay a former NBA player to wear a caveman outfit and try to beat the current guys. Not only would you get people to laugh while working in one of your brand mascots, but if the caveman actually won it would generate actual news stories. The last time that was done successfully was when Nokia had a dressed up rabbit win a road race it sponsored. Diament said there will be no geckos or cavemen on the court this time around.\n\nThe competition is set to start at 6 p.m. ET and we figure there's enough of a pad so that if it gets ridiculous, they'll be done by the time they have to be off the air by 7 p.m. But to us, this is the most exciting part of the weekend, including the game.\n\nIt's why we're saying it here right now that next year's Saturday night ticket will get you a seat into the arena to see H-O-R-S-E, or G-E-I-C-O, or whatever it's called then.\n\nQuestions?

         "Europe's biggest medical device maker, Smith & Nephew, is close to bidding about $11 billion for its U.S. rival Biomet, sources familiar with the situation said Sunday (Play-By-Play: Conditions Right For More Merger Mania).\n\nOne of the sources told Reuters bids were due by Tuesday and other companies were also likely to submit offers for Biomet.\n\nS&N, which would not comment, said on Nov. 2 it had held \"very preliminary talks\" over a tie-up with Biomet. Combining S&N and Biomet would help the two companies close the gap on the\n\nmarket leaders for joint implants -- U.S. groups Johnson & Johnson, Stryker and Zimmer.\n\nAnalysts have said a tie-up would probably take the form of an offer by S&N for Biomet pitched at between $10.5 billion and $12 billion, although a deal between the two is not certain since the U.S. company is likely to attract interest from rivals.\n\nS&N has long been tipped as a bidder for Biomet, which hired investment bank Morgan Stanley in April to consider its strategic options after long-time Chief Executive Dane Miller resigned.\n\nA source close to the matter told Reuters earlier in the year that the two companies held talks this summer, but no offer was made at the time.\n\nHigher Margins\n\nS&N Chief Executive Chris O'Donnell has said in the past he saw disadvantages to S&N being smaller than its major U.S. rivals and economies of scale could help improve margins.\n\nBut he has also cautioned that achieving cost savings in sales forces would not be easy, given the specialist nature of the products being sold.\n\nThe move on Biomet marks S&N's second recent attempt to grow via large-scale acquisition. It bid for Switzerland's Centerpulse in 2003, only to be beaten out by Zimmer. It may face stiff competition this time round, too.\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph newspaper reported that S&N could face rival trade buyers such as Johnson & Johnson, Stryker and Zimmer, while the Sunday Times newspaper said a private equity bidder may prove the main opposition for S&N.\n\nS&N itself is regularly rumored as a takeover target for larger U.S. peers and industry analysts believe an unsuccessful attempt to acquire Biomet could leave it vulnerable.\n\nMakers of joint implants have enjoyed strong sales growth in the past few years, driven by technological innovation, an aging population and increased demand for elective surgery among the \"baby boomers.\" But more recently investors have become concerned about pressure on prices charged for devices.",

         "House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Getty Images\n\nWASHINGTON — House Republicans will meet in a rare Saturday session as they plan their next move to keep the government open past midnight on Monday while extracting major concessions on President Obama's health care law. The Senate turned up the pressure on the House on Friday, passing a stopgap spending bill that would keep the government financed through Nov. 15 while leaving the health care law intact. Now, House Republicans must decide whether to accept the measure, attach minor changes to the health care law that could win Democratic support, or confront the Senate anew by again tying further government financing to a gutting of the law. Any move short of passing the Senate bill is likely to shut down the government, at least briefly, unless it is accompanied by a measure that would finance the government for at least a few days. That would allow the Republican to keep their struggle alive.\n\n(Read more: Why markets should pray for a US government shutdown)\n\nwatch now\n\nIn his Saturday radio and Internet address, the president will accuse Republicans in the House of being \"more concerned with appeasing an extreme faction of their party than working to pass a budget that creates new jobs or strengthens the middle class,\" according to a transcript released in advance. \"And in the next couple days, these Republicans will have to decide whether to join the Senate and keep the government open, or create a crisis that will hurt people for the sole purpose of advancing their ideological agenda,\" he adds. \"The American people have worked too hard to recover from crisis to see extremists in their Congress cause another one.\"\n\nRepresentative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, will use the Republican radio address on Saturday to shift the debate to another important deadline, Oct. 17, when Congress must raise the government's statutory borrowing limit or risk a potentially catastrophic default on the national debt.\n\nMore from The New York Times: U.S. and Iran Agree to Speed Talks Over Nuclear Dispute\n\nRace to the End for 'Breaking Bad' Binge-Viewers\n\nInKenya Attack, Narrow Escapes and Questions \"The president is now demanding that we increase the debt limit without engaging in any kind of bipartisan discussions about addressing our spending problem,\" Ms. Rodgers said. \"He wants to take the easy way out — exactly the kind of foolishness that got us here in the first place.\"\n\nCongressional Republicans are waging a two-front political war: one with Mr. Obama and the Democrats, the other within their own ranks.\n\nThe House Republicans' meeting, which is to begin at noon, is intended to produce spending legislation that is coupled with Republican health care demands, and the measure would face a vote on Sunday. That would leave the Senate just one day to deal with the House legislation before much of the government closes down for lack of funds. Without unanimous support in the Senate, the rules of the chamber would never let any such measure pass that quickly.\n\nwatch now",

Alicia Yap upgraded the Chinese entertainment stock to buy from neutral after Tencent released its fourth-quarter results. Tencent's total revenue for the fourth quarter was down year over year, but its subscription business grew. \"We believe TME's steady/resilient subscription music business with expanding capabilities of music value chain and ramp-up of long-form audio and diversified use case scenarios across multi-channels/devices would support sustained growth outlook,\" Yap said in a note to clients. Those subscriptions are expected to continue to be the key driver for the business moving forward. \"For 2024, management is confident that the online music business will maintain solid growth with subscription services serving as a primary driving force while continuing to explore new opportunities in advertising and artist merchandise to grow the business,\" the note said. Citi hiked its price target on Tencent Music to $13 per share from $9. The stock closed at $11.04 per share on Tuesday. — Jesse Pound 7:43 a.m.: Mizuho names Chevron a top pick, highlights delayed acquisition of Hess as catalyst A delayed acquisition has opened up a good entry point for shares of Chevron , according to Mizuho. The bank maintained its buy rating on the multinational energy giant and called Chevron a top pick. Analyst Nitin Kumar also raised his price target to $200 from $195, implying a 28% increase from the stock's Tuesday closing price. Chevron stock has added 5% so far this year. Kumar noted that the stock began the year outperforming its peers due to strong fourth-quarter earnings, until the company filed its proposed acquisition of Hess. \"Since then the stock has underperformed peers by ~6% as investors are concerned whether the deal will be completed since XOM and its partners are moving to,\" he wrote. Kumar's base case assumption still shows the deal going through, just with a Sep 30 close date versus June 30. Additionally, the analyst expects total production for Chevron to grow at a compound annual growth rate of between 10% to 11%, assuming that the Hess acquisition closes at the end of the third quarter. He also sees the company's current net asset value as looking attractive. \"Although the HES acquisition is ~7% accretive to NAV in our opinion, we still see value in standalone CVX especially given the recent underperformance compared to peers,\" Kumar wrote. — Lisa Kailai Han 7:38 a.m.: Needham upgrades Carmax to buy Carmax could soon be the upswing once again as the used car market begins to look more like it did before the Covid pandemic, according to Needham. Analyst Chris Pierce upgraded the stock to buy from hold, saying in a note to clients that the used car market could be on the road to recovery after a rocky few years. \"We see potential for a multi-year recovery, with interest rate relief and rising used vehicle supply pushing down [average selling prices] and monthly payments. We are confident in our above-consensus FY25 and FY26 retail unit estimates, which assume KMX's share gains resume and its omni-channel investments pay off as units grow,\" the note said. And even with concerns about the U.S. consumer weakening, the Carmax loan book appears to be in good shape, Pierce said. \"KMX's December loan default commentary was a positive surprise, with higher value loans on higher ASP vehicles seeing elevated early defaults, but subsequently reverting toward expectations as the loans season,\" the note said. Needham set a price target of $99 per share for Carmax, which is about 22% above where the stock closed Tuesday. — Jesse Pound 7:34 a.m.: Chipotle shares can continue rising amid strong growth, Deutsche Bank says Deutsche Bank sees more room to run for Chipotle shares as the fast-casual Mexican chain continues growing. Analyst Lauren Silberman raised her price target by $200 to $3,300 per share, which now implies an upside of 18% over Tuesday's close. Silberman also reiterated her buy rating. In a note titled \"Guac Costs Extra and So Does Growth,\" Silberman said she has high conviction in the near-term and long-term growth outlooks for the stock. The analyst said a premium multiple is deserved, given that there's few high-quality U.S. companies with clean balance sheets, strong fundamentals and the potential to see upside to performance metrics. \"CMG has been among the best-performing restaurant stocks and we expect fundamental strength to continue to drive outperformance,\" she wrote to clients. Silberman also praised Chipotle for its visibility into the path to 30% on margins. Its \"best-in-class\" unit economics offer another quality to like, she said. On Tuesday, Chipotle said its board approved a 50-to-1 stock split . The change is expected to go into effect in June if approved by shareholders earlier that month. Shares of Chipotle rose more than 6% in Wednesday premarket trading. The stock has climbed more than 22% this year. CMG YTD mountain CMG year to date — Alex Harring 7:31 a.m.: Spotify shares could still gain nearly 25%, according to Bank of America Bank of America is increasingly confident in Spotify's long-term potential. The firm maintained its buy rating on the streaming company and also raised its price target by $50 to $315, which suggests shares could climb 24.6%. The stock has already jumped more than 35% this year. \"The company is now at an inflection point which is driving share price performance over the last ~18 months and we are confident in the sustainability of this momentum driven by: 1) subscriber growth, 2) monetization opportunities (e.g. price increases), 3) scaling of advertising driven in large part by podcasting, 4) continued operating leverage,\" analyst Jessica Ehrlich wrote in a Wednesday note, adding that first-quarter earnings should come out at least in line with guidance. Spotify is on track to see positive gross margins, operating income and free cash flow, according to Ehrlich. The company's free cash flow trajectory and strong balance sheet pave the way for it to initiate a share repurchase program, which could boost shares higher in the second half of this year, the analyst added. — Pia Singh 6:48 a.m.: JPMorgan upgrades bitcoin mining firm Riot Platforms, forecasts more than 35% upside Investors should look to bitcoin mining company Riot Platforms after the recent increase in bitcoin prices, according to JPMorgan. Although shares on Tuesday declined to their lowest level, $11.09, since the Securities and Exchange Commission's bitcoin ETF approval, analyst Reginald Smith remains optimistic and upgraded the stock to overweight from neutral. His $15 price target assumes a $60,000 bitcoin price and suggests 35.2% potential upside for the stock. Smith cited the Riot's decline as a result of the stagnant hashrate growth, equity dilution and broader industry profit taking. \"We like Riot's unique combination of industry-leading power contracts, scale and liquidity (Riot last reported ~$600M in cash and $470M worth of bitcoin), and think shares offer the best relative upside among the three largest and most liquid U.S.-listed mining stocks,\" Smith wrote in a Wednesday note. Riot shares are down more than 28% year to date. RIOT YTD mountain RIOT in 2024 — Pia Singh 6:23 a.m.: Citi downgrades Wells Fargo Citi downgraded Wells Fargo to neutral from buy, saying the bank's valuation has already priced in the potential for earnings per share revisions. Analyst Keith Horowitz raised his target price by $6 to $63, however, which implies the stock could gain 10.5% from Tuesday's close. Shares are up 15.8% year to date. \"We continue to see tailwinds from fixed asset repricing, growth across fee categories and improved efficiency, but our estimates are not too far above the Street. With WFC trading at a premium relative to peers on our implied cost of equity metric, we believe the risk/reward is fairly balanced,\" analyst Horowitz wrote in a Tuesday note, saying Wells Fargo has been one of his top picks among the G-SIBs, or global systemically important banks. — Pia Singh 6:03 a.m.: Netflix shares should 'trade at a premium,' according to KeyBanc KeyBanc Capital Markets thinks Netflix can grow consistently going forward. Analyst Justin Patterson maintained his overweight rating and upped his price target by $125 to $705, suggesting shares of the streaming giant could gain 13.6% over the next year. He also increased his earnings per share estimates for this year and 2024. \"We continue to see signs that: 1) Netflix's content quality is improving; and 2) in our view, this creates a clear catalyst path as engagement should drive a monetization ramp (both in price increases and ad revenue),\" Patterson wrote in a Tuesday, anticipating Netflix to have a more balanced growth between subscribers and monetization over the medium term. \"Given more recurring revenue, an emerging ad revenue stream, and consistent 20%+ EPS growth, we believe NFLX should trade at a premium to peers.\" Netflix shares are up 27.5% so far this year. — Pia Singh 5:55 a.m.: Analysts think Nvidia is still a buy after GTC conference Several analysts remain bullish on Nvidia after the darling chipmaker's artificial intelligence GTC conference this week, during which CEO Jensen Huang gave a two-hour keynote speech about Nvidia's growing lineup of software and hardware products. Here's what some of them had to say: Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer raised his price target on the stock to $1,100, implying upside of 23%. \"Nvidia has transformed from a graphics company to a premier leading AI computing platform company. GPUs were initially used for graphics in video games and film. Given its parallel processing capabilities and thousands of computing cores, GPU are now optimized for deep learning AI algorithms in datacenters.\" Piper Sandler hiked its price target to $1,050 from $850, noting: \"We view the new architecture as an expansion of the already dominant market positioning of NVDA's hardware offering. We maintain that NVDA is the leading company in offering the full hardware and software stack to address the decade long transition to accelerated computing and generative AI.\" The new price target implies upside of 17.5%. Bank of America reiterated its buy rating and $1,100 price target, naming Nvidia a \"top compute pick\" following the conference. Blackwell's pricing should allow Nvidia to sustain mid-70% gross margins, and adoption of the new chips could be among the fastest in company history given its affordability across various customer bases, analyst Vivek Arya said. Nvidia shares closed at $893.98 on Tuesday. The stock — which is up 80.5% for the year — traded 0.2% lower in premarket trading. — Pia Singh 5:55 a.m.: Broadcom a strong play for '2nd wave of AI', Barclays says Looking for another way to capitalize on the artificial intelligence craze? Barclays thinks investors should look no further than Broadcom . The bank reinstated coverage of the semiconductor stock at an overweight rating. Its price target of $1,405 implies upside of nearly 14%. \"The company joins our preferred names this year as another way to play the 2nd Wave of AI via a best-in-class data center silicon portfolio,\" analyst Tom O'Malley wrote. \"In the near term, AI is all that matters and the custom silicon/switching businesses are driving a significant portion of near-term growth (we forecast a mid/high-20% range next year and for it to accelerate longer term).\" \"Outside of AI, the company is seeing many of the same cyclical downturns as Semi peers but a growing software business helps boost profitability and [free cash flow] generation,\" he said. Broadcom shares are up 10% year to date, lagging Nvidia — which has soared 80%. That said, Broadcom is outperforming the S & P 500's 8.6% gain. AVGO YTD mountain AVGO year to date — Fred Imbert",

         "BELFAST, NORTHERN IRELAND - FEBRUARY 3: First Minister Michelle O'Neill speaks during proceedings of the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont on February 3, 2024 in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\n\nLONDON — A referendum on Irish reunification could be in the cards within a decade, according to Northern Ireland's first-ever nationalist first minister, who took office at the weekend.\n\nSinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill was appointed as first minister on Saturday, the first Irish nationalist to hold the office since Northern Ireland was founded as a Protestant-majority state in 1921. The Democratic Unionist Party's Emma Little-Pengelly was appointed deputy first minister.\n\nIt came after the Northern Ireland Assembly, the country's devolved parliament, reconvened for the first time in two years on Saturday after the U.K. loyalist DUP reached a deal with the British government to end a boycott over post-Brexit trade arrangements.\n\nThe island to the west of England is divided in two; Northern Ireland is part of the U.K., whereas its neighbor, the Republic of Ireland, is an independent nation and a member of the European Union.\n\nUntil now, Northern Ireland's first minister has always come from a British unionist party, but Sinn Fein, which advocates for Northern Ireland to rejoin the Republic, won the most seats in the assembly for the first time in 2022.\n\nThe DUP, Northern Ireland's largest British unionist party, boycotted the assembly in February 2022 in protest over post-Brexit trade rules and refused to return for two years, leaving the country of 1.9 million people without a functioning administration. The deal that secured its return includes a contribution of more than £3 billion ($3.8 billion) from the British government for Northern Ireland's public services.\n\nThe power-sharing rules of the assembly, enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement — a landmark 1998 peace deal that brought an end to three decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland — mean that the executive, which runs the country, must include both unionist and nationalist representatives.",

         "Children participate in an activity in class at the Xavier Academy on August 23, 2021 in Houston, Texas. In-person classroom sessions are resuming and schools around Houston are requiring mask mandates, keeping in accordance with CDC guidelines.\n\nA federal judge in Texas ruled Wednesday that Gov. Greg Abbott's executive order banning mask mandates in schools violates the Americans with Disabilities Act, setting the stage for school districts in the state to decide whether they want to impose mask rules.\n\nU.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel wrote in a 29-page ruling that the ADA, a federal law enacted in 1990, supersedes Abbott's July order banning facial coverings in schools.\n\n\"The spread of COVID-19 poses an even greater risk for children with special health needs. Children with certain underlying conditions who contract COVID-19 are more likely to experience severe acute biological effects and to require admission to a hospital and the hospital's intensive-care unit,\" Yeakel said. \"This includes children with conditions including, Down syndrome, organ transplants, lung conditions, heart conditions, and weakened immune systems.\"\n\nYeakel added, \"The evidence presented by Plaintiffs establishes that Plaintiffs are being denied the benefits of in-person learning on an equal basis as their peers without disabilities.\"\n\nThe ruling also prohibits Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton from enforcing the governor's order, which imposes a fine of up to $1,000 for any entity that issues a mask mandate.\n\nPaxton's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in August by families of students with disabilities and an advocacy group called Disability Rights Texas. The suit argued that Abbott's ban denies children with pre-existing conditions equal access to a safe education.\n\n\"Governor Abbott's executive order clearly violates federal law, and Attorney General Paxton's enforcement of the order against school districts is now stopped,\" said Kym Davis Rogers, an attorney for the group, in a statement.\n\n\"As the court found, Texas is not above federal law, and state officials cannot prevent school districts from providing accommodations to students who are especially vulnerable to the risks of COVID-19. We are thankful that school districts can now take the steps necessary to protect these students. No student should be forced to make the choice of forfeiting their education or risking their health, and now they won't have to.\"\n\nWednesday's ruling comes as GOP-led states such as Florida and Iowa have banned mask mandates in schools.\n\nThe majority of public schools in Texas began in-person classes in August. More than 210,000 students have tested positive for Covid-19, according to state data.\n\nThe Department of Justice filed a statement of interest in the Texas case in late September, arguing Abbott's executive order would harm students with disabilities.\n\n\"The serious adverse consequences on students with certain disabilities is readily foreseeable,\" the Justice Department wrote. \"Some parents of children at heightened COVID-19 risk will likely keep their children at home—even though the children could safely attend school if mask protocols could be put in place.\"",

         "CNBC's Jim Cramer said Tuesday he sees more near-term upside for shares of Abbott Laboratories as the U.S. grapples with the Covid delta variant.\n\nThe \"Mad Money\" host pointed specifically to the company's BinaxNOW coronavirus test, a self-administered diagnostic that can be bought over the counter at pharmacy chains like Walgreens and CVS .\n\n\"This Binax is now the hottest product on the market. Just as Abbott had to pre-announce how poorly Binax was doing, sometimes I wonder if they have to pre-announce to the upside now that it's doing so well,\" Cramer said.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration authorized Abbott Labs' rapid Covid test for at-home use in December, right around the time vaccines for the disease were cleared on an emergency use basis. As availability of the BinaxNOW test increased during the spring, so too did access to Covid vaccines, which helped drive down coronavirus infection levels across the country.\n\nNow, in recent weeks, coronavirus cases have jumped in the U.S., leading Cramer to believe more and more Americans are going to seek out Abbott Labs' rapid test.\n\n\"We've got so many antivaxxers in this country that they've kept the pandemic alive and now we've got new variants with a decent chance of breaking through the vaccines from Pfizer and, to a lesser extent, Moderna. You know what that means? Testing, testing, testing,\" Cramer said.\n\nThe Covid situation also is benefiting shares of Regeneron , which makes an antibody therapy to treat the disease, Cramer said.\n\n\"The tables have turned, the fortunes restored for Regeneron and Abbott Labs. Their stocks have been up all along with all the other slowdown winners,\" Cramer said, alluding to the fact shares of Regeneron and Abbott Labs are up 11% and 7%, respectively, in the past month. That compares with the S&P 500's roughly 2.8% gain in the same time period.\n\n\"Now they have another kicker, and I think they've still got higher to go,\" Cramer said.",

         "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order on Monday prohibiting any entity, including private businesses, from imposing Covid-19 vaccination requirements on employees or customers.\n\n\"The COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective, and our best defense against the virus, but should remain voluntary and never forced,\" said Abbott said in a statement.\n\nAbbott, a Republican, said in his order that it was prompted by the Biden administration's vaccine federal mandate, which the governor called federal overreach.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced a mandate last month requiring companies with 100 or more employees to ensure that their workforces are vaccinated or regularly tested. The Labor Department has yet to release details of the emergency rule, but Biden last week called on companies to act now and not to wait for the requirement to go into effect.\n\nAbbott, who tested positive for Covid in August, has also resisted mask mandates and requiring proof of vaccination in the state. The state has continued to experience a rise in cases and crowded hospitals, prompting the governor to invest in monoclonal antibody infusion centers.\n\nAbbott issued executive orders over the summer banning local governments and school districts from requiring either masks or vaccines, issuing a $1,000 fine to those who failed to comply. School districts in San Antonio and Dallas, however, have challenged the order in court. The state legislature also passed a bill in June banning private businesses requiring vaccination proof from customers.\n\nIn Monday's order, Abbott also sent a memo to the chief clerk of the state House of Representatives and the secretary of the state Senate requesting to codify the mandate in a bill. The governor said the order will be rescinded when the GOP-controlled legislature passes the bill.\n\nOther GOP-led states have taken similar approaches to Texas. Montana passed a bill banning vaccine requirements by employers. Earlier this year, Florida also banned businesses from requiring proof of vaccination.",

Greg Abbott's reelection campaign last month, as he geared up to fight a federal Covid-19 vaccine mandate, according to a new federal filing.\n\nThe donation came as the retail industry has expressed concerns about the mandate weighing on operations as the holiday shopping season approaches and America faces labor shortages.\n\nThe contribution also came after Abbott, a Republican who is up for reelection next year, signed a law that effectively bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, as well as legislation that includes voting restrictions.\n\nArkansas-based Walmart made the $10,000 donation, dated Sept. 29, through its \"PAC for sustainable government,\" according to a Federal Election Commission filing.\n\nThe mega retailer's donation to Abbott was the biggest contribution it gave to any state or federal elected official that month. The Walmart PAC also contributed $5,000 to Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, also a Republican.\n\nRecords show Walmart has contributed to both Abbott's and Patrick's campaigns in the past. The company has also contributed to Democrats.\n\n\"As a company that operates in all 50 states, it is necessary for us to engage political leaders from both parties across a broad spectrum of policy matters. Our company and PAC engage in a bipartisan manner based on a range of issues that impact our associates, customers and shareholders,\" a Walmart representative told CNBC.\n\n\"We have not been and will never be a single-issue contributor, and we recognize that at times elected officials will back legislation we don't support or condone. However, it's important that we continue to engage in the political process and make our views known to policymakers and other stakeholders.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden in September announced that his administration would implement a Covid vaccine mandate that would cover private businesses with 100 or more workers.

         "Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced the US Army Corps of Engineers and the state are putting up a 250-bed field hospital at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center in downtown Dallas during a press conference at the Texas State Capitol in Austin, Sunday, March 29, 2020.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday ordered the Legislature to reconvene for a third time to try to pass a Republican-backed voting restrictions bill that Democratic members blocked by leaving the state nearly a month ago.\n\nThe announcement, which had been expected, puts new pressure on the more than 50 Democratic lawmakers who left Texas for Washington, D.C., on July 12 and have remained there since. They had been preparing to celebrate running out the clock on the current 30-day special session that ends Friday, which would torpedo the sweeping elections overhaul for the second time since May.\n\nBut their holdout may not be over. Some Democrats said this week that they had no intention of returning to the state Capitol, even after they return to Texas and face possible arrest to compel their attendance.\n\nState Rep. Chris Turner, the leader of the House Democratic Caucus, would not say following Abbott's announcement whether they would return before the new session begins Saturday. But asked about members who say they will keep refusing to show up, Turner told The Associated Press: \"It's very much under discussion. I'll just leave it at that.\"\n\nAbbott, who is up for reelection in 2022, made a new elections package part of a 17-item agenda he instructed the GOP-led Legislature to consider over the next month. It includes other hot-button measures sought by conservative activists, including new border security measures and rules over how race is taught in public schools.\n\n\"I will continue to call special session after special session to reform our broken bail system, uphold election integrity, and pass other important items that Texans demand and deserve,\" Abbott said.\n\nThe cross-country exodus last month marked the second time that Democratic lawmakers staged a walkout on the voting overhaul, which they say would make it harder for young people, people of color and people with disabilities to vote. But like the first effort in May, there remains no clear path for Democrats to permanently block the voting measures or the other contentious GOP-backed proposals up for debate.\n\nBut Democratic state Rep. Eddie Rodriguez said Wednesday that there was enough will to keep trying.\n\n\"A vast majority, enough to break quorum, have committed to each other to not be in the Capitol when the second called session happens,\" Rodriguez said.\n\nAbbott last month vowed to arrest Democrats once they return to Texas.\n\n\"I don't think arresting Democrats and forcing them to the Statehouse, most of us being Hispanic or African American, or Asian American for that matter, that's not a good look,\" Rodriguez said. \"I would hope they would take that into account. But that's up to them. Again, we don't have a lot in our control.\"\n\nIn choosing to hunker down in Washington, the Democrats sought to put pressure on President Joe Biden and Congress to pass new federal voting rights legislation that would blunt the impact of the GOP bill in Texas. A group of key Democratic senators, including West Virginia's Joe Manchin, met Wednesday in Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's office to discuss a compromise on voting legislation.\n\nThe group's members have been working for weeks with their counterparts in the U.S. House to develop a narrower approach. But even with a retooled bill, they would still face the same challenge as before: a filibuster by Senate Republicans, who overwhelmingly oppose the measure. Overcoming that hurdle would require changes to Senate procedural rules, which many moderate Democrats oppose — denying the party the votes to change the rule.\n\nAlthough the Texas Democrats have met with Vice President Kamala Harris, a White House official said Biden had no plans to meet with them.",

         "Elon Musk on Thursday declined to weigh in directly on Texas' abortion law after Gov. Greg Abbott said the Tesla and SpaceX CEO supported his state's \"social policies\" following the implementation of the harshly restrictive measure.\n\n\"In general, I believe government should rarely impose its will upon the people, and, when doing so, should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness,\" Musk told CNBC in a tweet.\n\n\"That said, I would prefer to stay out of politics,\" said Musk, whose companies and private foundation are both growing their operations in Texas.\n\nAbortion rights advocates and providers say the law effectively overturns precedent for abortion protections set under Roe v.

President Joe Biden and others in his administration, as well as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., have vowed to take action after the Supreme Court refused to block the law from taking effect.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Abbott told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" that the new law and other politically divisive social issue laws will not make his state less appealing to businesses or individuals.\n\n\"You need to understand that there's a lot of businesses and a lot of Americans who like the social positions that the state of Texas is taking,\" Abbott said.",

         "Texas Gov. Abbott blames Covid spread on immigrants, criticizes Biden's 'Neanderthal' comment",
         "watch now\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday criticized President Joe Biden for calling his decisions to lift Covid-19 restrictions and mask mandates earlier this week \"Neanderthal thinking\" and blamed the state's ongoing outbreak on undocumented immigrants. Abbott's comments come after his widely criticized decision on Tuesday to rescind most of the state's Covid-19 restrictions, including a statewide mask mandate. Texas businesses will be allowed to open \"100%,\" effective March 10, he said. Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves made a similar move at roughly the same time. Biden on Wednesday slammed the governors for what he said was a \"big mistake\" and added that \"the last thing we need is Neanderthal thinking.\" Abbott told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that the comment was \"not the type of word that a president should be using\" and blamed the spread of the coronavirus on immigrants crossing the southern border. The Republican governor said the Biden administration has \"refused to test\" them for the virus.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"The Biden administration has been releasing immigrants in South Texas that have been exposing Texans to Covid. Some of those people have been put on buses, taking that Covid to other states in the United States,\" Abbott told CNBC. \"That is Neanderthal-type approach to dealing with the Covid situation.\" While the Republican governor didn't provide specifics, Telemundo reported on Tuesday that some migrants released by Border Patrol in the Texas city of Brownsville subsequently tested positive for Covid-19. Since the city began testing on Jan. 25, 108 migrants have tested positive for Covid-19, which is 6.3% of all those who took a test, according to the report. \"The Biden administration must stop importing Covid into our country,\" Abbott said. Top U.S. health officials have repeatedly urged states not to lift Covid-19 restrictions as nationwide coronavirus cases and deaths stall and highly transmissible variants threaten to \"hijack\" the recent decline in infections. However, Abbott defended his decision to lift the state's mask requirements, claiming that Texans already know that \"the safe standard, among other things, is to wear a mask.\" \"Do they really need the state to tell them what they already know for their own personal behavior?\" Abbott told CNBC. The governor added that the state's coronavirus infections are \"at four-month lows\" and Texas hospitals stand ready to treat an influx of patients if needed. Texas is reporting a daily average of roughly 7,265 new cases over the last week, a drop compared with the peak of more than 20,400 daily cases the state reported in January, according to a CNBC analysis of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nHowever, new infections have started to creep back up across the state, with average daily new cases growing by nearly 13% compared with a week ago. Abbott said most of the state's coronavirus spread over the holiday was driven by indoor gatherings, not by restaurants and other businesses. The newly lifted restrictions \"are not really that transformative\" because the state's mask mandate wasn't enforced and businesses were already at 75% capacity, he said. \"Maybe to people in New York it seems like this is a big difference,\" Abbott said. — CNBC's Will Feuer contributed to this report.",

         "The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday announced that it has authorized Abbott Labs ' rapid Covid-19 test for at-home use, though doctors must prescribe the test for patients.\n\nThe test, which is an antigen test that delivers results in about 15 minutes, had previously been authorized for use by trained personnel only, but the new clearance will allow patients to test themselves at home with virtual assistance from a doctor. It's the third test authorized in the U.S. \"that can be used completely at home,\" Dr. Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement.\n\nTo deliver the test, which is called BinaxNOW and costs $25 for at-home use, to people's homes and to supervise the collection and testing process, Abbott said it has partnered with telehealth provider eMed. Patients collect the sample with a nasal swab themselves and an app helps guide the testing process and provide results, Abbott said.\n\nEveryone 15 years or older who are suspected of having Covid-19 by their health-care provider and is within the first seven days of symptom onset are eligible for the test, the FDA said. The test can also be used in people 4 years or older, though an adult needs to collect the sample, the agency said.\n\n\"FDA continues to authorize COVID-19 tests that will give more Americans access to greater testing flexibility and options,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said in a statement. \"The BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Home Test will have a significant manufacturing footprint with the potential to support testing for millions of people.\"\n\nAbbott said it expects to deliver 30 million at-home tests in the first quarter of 2021, with another 90 million in the second quarter. The FDA noted that antigen tests are not as accurate as many molecular tests.\n\n\"As the pandemic has evolved, the need for rapid testing has only grown. Unfortunately, we're still hearing that many people can't access testing as quickly as they need it,\" Robert Ford, Abbott's president and CEO, said in a statement. \"That's why Abbott is bringing our rapid BinaxNOW test and NAVICA platform into homes.\"\n\nThe FDA first authorized the test for use by trained personnel in August, touting it at the time as the first Covid-19 test that costs about $5 and delivers results in minutes on a testing card without lab equipment, similar to a pregnancy test. The U.S. quickly purchased 150 million of the tests for $750 million to expand testing capacity.\n\nHowever, at-home use of the test will cost $25, more than the $5 it costs in medical settings, Abbott said Wednesday.\n\n\"FDA's authorization of the BinaxNOW card test for home use means we should have tens of millions of COVID-19 tests in the coming months that Americans can use without leaving their home,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Wednesday in a statement.\n\nThe authorization comes after the FDA cleared Ellume's at-home Covid test on Tuesday. That product was authorized for use in anyone 2 years or older and does not require a prescription.",

He sits down with the CEO of cloud-based cybersecurity provider Zscaler to get an understanding of the competitive landscape.\n\nEye on the market: Ignore the Fed talk next week\n\nTwo conflicting forces are working to influence the market and the \"bad set\" happened to win out on Friday, CNBC's said. China's trade delegation decided to cut short its trip to Washington for trade talks with the United States. The major averages all finished the session down less than 1% as it seemed unlikely the country would resume buying goods from American farmers. Looking past parts of the economy implicated in the U.S.-China trade war, employment is strong and domestic companies without Chinese exposure continue to have a positive impact, Cramer said. In the week ahead, the \"Mad Money\" host advised viewers not to pay attention to Federal Reserve reactions and to realize that the strong domestic economy and internationally-oriented economy are both balancing \"on a knife's edge.\" \"That's the right prism to use if you want to understand this market,\" he said.\n\nProjecting iPhone sales and the market's reaction\n\nA customer inspects two Apple iPhones at an Apple Store in Shanghai, China.

         "AbbVie deal may conclude a tumultuous 4 years for Botox-maker Allergan",
         "The company's leadership has come under pressure from activist investor from David Tepper for management changes. Shareholders have been calling for Allergan to split or sell the company.\n\nAllergan, the maker of Botox and blockbuster eye treatment Restatis, isn't the same industry leader it once was. The stock has lost about half its value since 2017. The drugmaker has struggled ever since its planned $160 billion mega deal with Pfizer fell through in 2016 after pushback from the Obama administration, analysts say. The pharmaceutical company has also been hit with drug trial setbacks and generic competition.\n\nAt the time, Allergan was selling its generic drug business to Israel drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical for $40.5 billion. The cash and stock deal, announced in July 2015, was seen by investors as a positive for the Ireland-based pharmaceutical company. It freed Allergan to focus on more bankable brand-name drugs, while also providing it with more cash to pay down debt. Allergan is \"trying to move higher up into the food chain, so they'll probably go after a branded drug company,\" Cooperman, the Omega Advisors chairman and CEO, told CNBC in an interview on July 28, 2015 . \"Maybe AbbVie.\"\n\n\"Investors have been frustrated,\" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Randall Stanicky, who has been calling for a break up Allergan since 2017. He said a combination of drug trial setbacks, disappointments with capital deployment, strategic missteps and the company's inability to grow earnings has pressured the stock.\n\nNow, Allergan's fortunes may change. AbbVie announced Tuesday it would buy Allergan for about $63 billion, a 45% premium over Allergan's closing share price of $129.57 on Monday. According to the deal, Allergan shareholders will receive 0.866 AbbiVie share and $120.30 in cash for each Allergan share for a total value of $188.24 a share. If approved, the deal would combine two struggling companies seeking growth.\n\nStanicky said the deal is a \"nice exit from a tough situation\" for Allergan. \"I think investors should be happy with this exit,\" he added.\n\nAllergan investors cheered the deal Tuesday. Shares of Allergan surged 25.4% on Tuesday while AbbVie shares fell 16.3%.\n\nAbbVie has been looking to diversify its portfolio as blockbuster arthritis treatment Humira faces competition from cheaper versions in Europe and faces expiration of its patents in the U.S. in 2023. Allergan's aesthetics products and eye care and other medicines could help AbbVie shore up revenue.\n\nDavid Maris, a research analyst at Wells Fargo who covers Allergan, told CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Tuesday that he isn't convinced that the deal is a better long-term alternative for Allergan shareholders looking past Humira's patent expiration. But in a follow-up phone interview, Maris added that the stock had been underpeforming for so long, the board had to do something.\n\nThe deal is a \"little disappointing,\" Maris said.\" \"I can see why AbbVie wants to diversify away from Humira. I don't know why an Allergan shareholder would want to diversify into Humaria.\"\n\nJefferies health-care desk analyst Jared Holz said AbbVie's stock decline is a \"bit overdone,\" saying this solves a growth problem for each company. \"I feel like I'm the only person in the world who feels this deal isn't a disaster,\" he said. \"It is a homerun for Allergan shareholders.\"",

         "AbbVie shares fell almost 3 percent on Tuesday after the California Department of Insurance sued the pharmaceutical company for allegedly giving health-care providers kickbacks for prescribing its arthritis drug Humira.\n\nThe suit alleges that AbbVie provided cash, trips and other gifts to health-care providers as incentives to prescribe the drug. The company allegedly also provided additional professional services, such as free insurance processing and marketing assistance.\n\nThe scheme was pulled off by a group of registered nurses known as Abbvie Nurse Ambassadors, who are sent into patients' homes after they are prescribed Humira and were trained to downplay potential risks of the drug, according to the suit.\n\nThe company \"only provides the Ambassadors as long as the physicians continue to prescribe AbbVie's drug instead of selecting another course of treatment,\" according to the California Department of Insurance.\n\nAbbVie spokeswoman Adelle Infante said in a statement that the allegations had no merit.\n\n\"AbbVie provides a number of support services for patients, once they are prescribed Humira, that both educate and assist patients with their therapy, including nursing support, and these resources are beneficial to patients dealing with a chronic condition,\" Infante said. \"They in no way replace or interfere with interactions between patients and their healthcare providers.\"\n\nThe allegations were brought to the attention of the department by Lazaro Suarez, who was employed as an AbbVie Nurse Ambassador in Florida.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, private insurers have paid out $1.2 billion in pharmacy claims for Humira, which would make the case the largest instance of insurance fraud in the history of the California regulator.",

         "Senate panel grills pharma CEO over executive bonuses and sales of AbbVie blockbuster drug Humira",
         "Richard Gonzalez, chairman and chief executive officer of AbbVie Inc., listens during a Senate Finance Committee hearing on drug pricing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, Feb. 26, 2019.\n\nHumira sales are one of the company's four main financial targets — along with net revenues, operating margin and return on assets — that accounted for 60 percent of Gonzalez's short-term incentive plan. The plan pays out a cash award for each of the top five executives equal to up to 200 percent of their base salary, depending on if they meet the targets and other performance measures.\n\nHumira's $18.3 billion in 2017 sales — which rose 14.6 percent from the previous year and accounted for about 65 percent of the company's $28.1 billion in revenue — were a major factor in calculating the compensation for AbbVie's top executives last year, according to the company's most recent compensation data.\n\nA Senate panel grilled AbbVie Chairman and CEO Richard Gonzalez about tying executive bonuses to sales of the U.S. drugmaker's blockbuster arthritis treatment Humira.\n\nThe company hit its internal target for Humira sales last year, helping its top five executives to nearly max out their cash bonuses with a payout equal to 175 percent of their annual base pay, the company said.\n\n\"In 2017 all financial and strategic goals were materially achieved, resulting in performance scores between 99% and 100% of target,\" the company said.\n\nGonzalez, 64, made a total of $22.6 million for his performance in 2017, $4.3 million of which was his cash bonus. The rest of his compensation was base salary and a mix of stock, restricted shares and options.\n\n\"This strikes me as problematic,\" Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in questioning the CEO at a hearing on prescription drug costs before the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday. \"Would you make a smaller bonus if you dropped the price of Humira?\"\n\nIn response, Gonzalez said, \"Humira was one element of a set of financial factors that were evaluated as part of my compensation. It's obviously a very significant product for us. So it is clear it would be a part of the evaluation.\"\n\nWyden snapped back with, \"I'd like that in writing. It looks to me you'd be making a smaller bonus if you dropped the price of Humira. I'd like that in writing within 10 days.\"\n\nSince 2014, AbbVie has nearly doubled the price of its top-selling drug Humira, which is used to treat diseases including arthritis, plaque psoriasis and Crohn's, according to a review of data provided by Rx Savings Solutions. The drug now carries a list price of more than $60,000 per year.\n\nAbbVie has been aggressive in keeping cheaper copycat versions of its drug off the U.S. market. The company is not expected to face biosimilar competition in the U.S. until 2023.\n\nThe drug's list price and patent faced the brunt of the heat from senators at the hearing. At one point, Wyden likened AbbVie's patent practices to Gollum, the slimy \"Lord of the Rings\" character who coveted the ring of power.\n\n\"Can the patients opt for a less expensive alternative? They can't, because AbbVie protects the exclusivity of Humira like Gollum with his ring. Thick cobwebs of patents and shadowy deals with drugmakers, all of them are in place to keep the cash flowing,\" Wyden said.\n\nGonzalez argued the drug has so many patents because it's used to treat several different ailments.\n\nWATCH: Lawmakers grill pharma execs over high drug costs",

In a notice, the FDA also said that patients taking JAK inhibitors in general risked developing blood clots.\n\nAbbVie has been aggressively fending off competition for Humira by signing deals with rival companies to prevent their cheap versions of the drug from entering the United States, its biggest market, until 2023.\n\nHumira, which treats rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, is the world's best-selling medicine, and brought in global revenue of $4.87 billion in the second quarter, but sales have been falling as it faces competition from cheaper rivals in Europe.\n\nTo further diversify its pipeline, AbbVie in June announced a deal to buy Botox-maker Allergan for $63 billion.\n\nIt has also launched a new psoriasis medicine, Skyrizi, to help retain some market share.\n\nShares of the company rose 2.2% to $64.36 in early afternoon trade.",

         "2 AI beneficiaries that haven't caught up yet, according to top value investor",
         "Artificial intelligence-adjacent stocks have been the clear leaders of this bull rally, but there may still be some potential beneficiaries of the trend that haven't caught up yet, according to Aaron Dunn. While some investors have voiced their concerns over lofty valuations, Dunn, the co-head of value equity at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a portfolio manager on the Eaton Vance Value team, told CNBC in a recent interview that he's been keeping an eye on Micron and Accenture . Both stocks represent businesses with good returns, he said. Micron benefits from the consolidation of the memory business, while Accenture is capital light. Accenture is profitable, while Micron is not too far behind. Dunn believes that semiconductor manufacturer Micron could benefit as demand for memory chips begins to outpace supply once again. \"With AI, you need more memory,\" he said. \"I think we're going to go back to a period where memory is tight, and Micron has really good new technology that's also going to soak up excess capacity.\" In February, the firm announced that it had started production of its HBM3E, or High Bandwidth Memory wafer. These chips would be comparable with Nvidia's graphic processing units for AI capabilities, while also requiring less power and acting at higher speeds, Dunn said. Meanwhile, Micron could also be a beneficiary of the U.S.'s desire to have more of a domestic presence in the semiconductor chip market. \"Effectively, MU will be getting paid by the U.S. government to build in-country capacity,\" Dunn said. Shares of Micron have rallied 9% so far this year, but Nvidia has gained 77% over the same time period. The portfolio manger cautioned that while Micron shares have had a big runup — it's gained 77% since hitting a 52-week low last March — and may be at risk of a modest pullback, the stock's long-term fundamentals look to be very strong. MU 6M mountain MU 6-month chart Dunn also listed professional services firm Accenture as a potential AI beneficiary. Shares have added 7% so far this year, as of Friday's close. Accenture is likely to rally as firms begin to adopt AI and large language learning models into their business operations, Dunn said. \"Businesses will need help in understanding how AI should be used and the eventual implementation of those technologies,\" he said. \"Accenture is positioned to provide this. This is likely an inflection point for them that will define the intermediate trends for them.\" ACN 6M mountain ACN 6-month chart Dunn's fund, Eaton Vance's Focused Value Opportunities Fund , has underperformed its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Value Index , so far this year. Since 2014, the fund has outperformed its benchmark in five of the past nine years. It has an expense ratio of 1.04% and a neutral rating from Morningstar, which is partly attributed to its fee structure.",

         "It may seem in the not-too-distant past, but when Anatoly Roytman started his own digital agency in the second half of the 1990s, digital was deemed “a very new field.”\n\nYet it “worked great,” he said — that is until the internet bubble burst and he went bankrupt. So in a way, he had made it, and then lost everything.\n\n“I was starting from scratch (again),” said Roytman, now senior managing director of Accenture Interactive across Europe, Africa and Latin America (EALA).\n\nHe told CNBC’s Karen Tso on an episode of “What Drives You” how he had to find a new job and pick himself back up.\n\n“I joined Digitas — Digitas is an agency in the States. I was with them for six years until Publicis bought them. Then I decided to go and look for different types of companies where we could combine technology and creativity,” he said.",

         "3M announced Tuesday it will spin off its health-care business into a separate publicly traded company.\n\nThe new business will focus on wound and oral care, health-care IT and biopharma filtration, the material science company said in a release. That includes products like its bandages, skin adhesives, oral aligners, air purifiers and optical lenses.\n\nThe company's health-care products also include the Bair Hugger surgical warming system, which is currently the subject of nearly 6,000 lawsuits. 3M maintains that the product has no relation to surgical-site infections.\n\n3M health-care products recorded more than $8 billion in sales in 2021. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of next year, and 3M will maintain a 19.9% stake in the new company.\n\nThe announcement comes as 3M said its second-quarter revenue fell nearly 3% to $8.7 billion. Net income dropped to $78 million from $1.5 billion a year earlier, including a $1.2 billion pretax charge tied to resolving litigation related to Combat Arms Earplugs.\n\nThe company said Aearo Technologies, its subsidiary that produces Combat Arms Earplugs, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings to establish a trust to resolve all legal claims related to the product. 3M said it believe the earplugs were safe and effective when used properly, but that they nevertheless face increasing litigation.\n\nAfter excluding that one-time charge, 3M earned $2.48 per share. The performance topped expectations. According to Refinitv, analysts expected 3M to earn $2.42 per share on revenue of $8.58 billion.\n\nShares of the company closed up 5% at $140.82.\n\n3M is also simultaneously spinning off its food safety business. That branch will merge with Neogen and is expected to be divested by September.\n\n— Reuters contributed to this report.",

         "An employee unboxes N95 masks as part of a government strategy to distribute them to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) at Meijer in Southfield, Michigan, U.S., January 25, 2022.\n\n3M said on Tuesday it would cut 2,500 manufacturing jobs after reporting a lower profit, as the U.S. industrial conglomerate faces a demand slowdown in its unit that sells products including notebooks, air purifiers and respirators.\n\nThe move comes as corporate America has seen a string of layoffs with companies trying to rein in costs amid fears of a potential economic downturn.\n\nThe diversified manufacturer said demand for its consumer-facing unit fell faster in December as weaker customer spending spilled into the holiday season, sending its shares down 4.7% to $116.79 in premarket trading.\n\n3M expects adjusted sales growth to drop 6% to 2% this year due to declining disposable respirator sales and its exit from Russia.\n\n\"We expect macroeconomic challenges to persist in 2023,\" Chief Executive Mike Roman said.\n\nA softer-than-expected consumer spending and a cut back from U.S. retailers amid inflationary pressures has eaten into the sales of 3M's consumer unit which generated about $5.30 billion in revenue in 2022.\n\n\"As demand weakened, we adjusted manufacturing output and controlled costs, which enabled us to improve inventory levels,\" Roman added.\n\nThe company was able to offset higher raw material and logistics costs by raising prices which helped it beat profit in the previous quarter.\n\nSales in the quarter fell 6% to $8.1 billion. Excluding items, the company reported a profit of $2.28 per share compared to $2.45 per share a year earlier.",

         "3M combat earplug lawsuits to proceed, judge rules, despite bankruptcy case",
         "3M must face more than 230,000 lawsuits accusing it of selling defective earplugs to the U.S. military, after a U.S. judge on Friday ruled that the bankruptcy of a subsidiary did not stop lawsuits against the non-bankrupt parent company.\n\nCompanies that file for bankruptcy typically receive an immediate reprieve from lawsuits, and 3M subsidiary Aearo Technologies LLC argued that extending those protections to 3M would buy Aearo time to address its debts and restructuring goals.\n\nAearo and 3M had argued that bankruptcy offered a faster and fairer way to compensate veterans who say that earplugs made by Aearo caused hearing loss.\n\nBut bankruptcy Judge Jeffrey J. Graham in Indianapolis said that Aearo's bankruptcy restructuring could proceed in parallel with the lawsuits.\n\nWhile the \"sheer size\" of the consolidated litigation may have spurred 3M and Aearo to seek \"additional leverage\" through the bankruptcy proceedings, that did not create a legal need to protect 3M, Graham ruled.\n\nAttorneys representing the veterans with hearing loss said they looked forward to continuing their lawsuits against 3M in other courts.\n\n\"Judge Graham's decision is a complete rejection of 3M's attempt to evade accountability and hide in bankruptcy after multiple juries found it liable for knowingly causing hearing damage to those who served our nation,\" plaintiff attorneys Bryan Aylstock and Christopher Seeger said in a statement.\n\nA spokesman for 3M said it intended to appeal. 3M has set aside $1 billion to settle the earplug litigation.\n\n\"Continuing to litigate these cases one-by-one over the coming years will not provide certainty or fairness for any party,\" 3M spokesman Sean Lynch said.\n\n3M subsidiary Aearo Technologies LLC filed for bankruptcy protection in Indiana on July 26, seeking to resolve lawsuits alleging that 3M's Combat Arms Earplugs Version 2 (CAEv2) caused hearing loss.\n\nThe lawsuits have been consolidated in federal court in Florida and have grown into the largest mass tort litigation in U.S. history. Aearo placed $1 billion in a trust to settle them and agreed to indemnify 3M for all liability related to CAEv2.\n\n3M has denied liability, saying its earplugs offered protection to soldiers while allowing them to hear on the battlefield.\n\n",

         "Watch out for these coronavirus scams, SEC and FTC warn",
         "If you've seen research reports or promotions touting opportunities to invest with companies that are working to cure coronavirus, think twice before buying stock shares.\n\nThat's according to U.S. regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, which all released investor alerts in the past week warning Americans about an uptick in investment scams attempting to take advantage of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\"Fraudsters often use the latest news developments to lure investors into scams,\" the SEC's office of investor education and advocacy said in a Feb. 4 email. The coronavirus has particularly dominated the news cycle in past weeks. As of Feb. 10, China's National Health Commission reported the coronavirus has killed over 1,000 people and infected more than 42,600 in China.\n\nThe SEC released its warning after it became aware of \"a number of Internet promotions, including on social media, claiming that the products or services of publicly traded companies can prevent, detect or cure coronavirus, and that the stock of these companies will dramatically increase in value as a result.\"\n\nBut as the World Health Organization noted on Feb. 5, there are \"no known effective therapeutics\" available at this time to fight coronavirus, despite news reports in recent days touting breakthroughs. Chinese President Xi Jinping has vowed to crack down on misinformation about coronavirus prevention and treatment.\n\n\"We know scammers follow the headlines and it would not be surprising to see fraudulent pitches related to medical or bio-technology, or 'sure cures' related to the coronavirus situation,\" says Bob Webster, a spokesman for the North American Securities Administrators Association, an investor protection organization comprised of state regulators.",

         "The AI industry is pushing a nuclear power revival — partly to fuel itself",
         "Tech firms and Silicon Valley billionaires have been pouring money into nuclear energy for years, pitching the sustainable power source as crucial to the green transition. Now they have another incentive to promote it: artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile generative AI has grown at lightning speed, nuclear power projects are heavily regulated and usually advance at a plodding pace. That's raising questions about whether advances in nuclear energy can cut emissions as swiftly as energy-guzzling AI and other fast-growing technologies are adding to them.\n\n\"If you were to integrate large language models, GPT-style models into search engines, it's going to cost five times as much environmentally as standard search,\" said Sarah Myers West, managing director of the AI Now Institute, a research group focused on the social impacts of AI. At current growth rates, some new AI servers could soon gobble up more than 85 terawatt hours of electricity each year, researchers have estimated — more than some small nations' annual energy consumption.\n\n\"I want to see innovation in this country,\" Myers West said. \"I just want the scope of innovation to be determined beyond the incentive structures of these giant companies.\"\n\nOklo is one of the nuclear startups backed by Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI who has described AI and cheap, green energy as mutually reinforcing essentials to achieving a future marked by \"abundance.\"\n\n\"Fundamentally today in the world, the two limiting commodities you see everywhere are intelligence, which we're trying to work on with AI, and energy,\" he told CNBC in 2021 after investing $375 million in Helion Energy, a nuclear fusion startup that Altman chairs. Microsoft last year agreed to buy power from Helion starting in 2028. Oklo, which Altman also chairs, is focused on the opposite reaction, fission, which generates energy by splitting an atom; fusion does so by merging atomic nuclei.\n\nRepresentatives for Altman, through his special acquisition company AltC, didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn rural southeastern Idaho, Oklo is working to build a small-scale nuclear powerhouse that could fuel data centers like the ones OpenAI and its competitors need. But the company also wants to supply mixed-use communities and industrial facilities, and is already contracted to build two commercial plants in southern Ohio.\n\nAs the United States moves toward wide-scale electric vehicle adoption and decarbonization, \"the amount of energy we're going to need to do that is huge,\" said Oklo CEO and co-founder Jacob DeWitte. \"Also heating and cooking — if we want to electrify those processes, you're going to need even more.\"\n\nOklo has found getting regulators on board harder than finding potential customers.\n\nIn 2022, the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which oversees commercial nuclear power plants and materials, denied the company's application for the design of its Idaho \"Aurora\" powerhouse, saying it hadn't provided enough safety information. In October, the Air Force rescinded its intent to award a contract for a microreactor pilot program to power a base in Alaska.\n\n\"You've got new physics, you have to use new models. You have to do all sorts of stuff that's different than what they're used to,\" DeWitte said of the NRC. Oklo is now working to satisfy regulators, he said, acknowledging agency officials must \"do their independent job of ensuring this meets adequate safety requirements.\"\n\nOklo's proposed 13,000 square-foot Aurora powerhouse, featuring a 15-megawatt fission reactor, is smaller than earlier plants and looks more like a sleek ski chalet than the Cold War-era ones with their iconic curved towers. The plant set to be built at the Idaho National Laboratory, a research facility where Oklo has been given an Energy Department grant to test recycling nuclear waste into new fuel. DeWitte says the design is safer, too, citing the use of liquid metal as a coolant rather than water.\n\nThe nuclear power industry hasn't meaningfully expanded its share of the U.S. energy mix for decades. It has chugged along despite popular opposition fueled by infrequent but devastating accidents like those in Chernobyl, Ukraine, in 1986 and in Fukushima, Japan, in 2011. But as the climate crisis accelerates, most Americans now support expanding nuclear energy — 57%, up from 43% in 2020, a Pew Research survey found last year.\n\nNuclear power currently makes up only 19% of the nation's overall energy generation, with 93 commercial reactors operating today, down from a peak of 112 in 1990. By one estimate, up to 800 gigawatts of new nuclear power will be needed by 2050 to meet current green energy targets.",

         "House G.O.P. to Plan Next Step as Budget Clock Runs Down",
         "House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Getty Images\n\nWASHINGTON — House Republicans will meet in a rare Saturday session as they plan their next move to keep the government open past midnight on Monday while extracting major concessions on President Obama's health care law. The Senate turned up the pressure on the House on Friday, passing a stopgap spending bill that would keep the government financed through Nov. 15 while leaving the health care law intact. Now, House Republicans must decide whether to accept the measure, attach minor changes to the health care law that could win Democratic support, or confront the Senate anew by again tying further government financing to a gutting of the law. Any move short of passing the Senate bill is likely to shut down the government, at least briefly, unless it is accompanied by a measure that would finance the government for at least a few days. That would allow the Republican to keep their struggle alive.\n\n(Read more: Why markets should pray for a US government shutdown)\n\nwatch now\n\nIn his Saturday radio and Internet address, the president will accuse Republicans in the House of being \"more concerned with appeasing an extreme faction of their party than working to pass a budget that creates new jobs or strengthens the middle class,\" according to a transcript released in advance. \"And in the next couple days, these Republicans will have to decide whether to join the Senate and keep the government open, or create a crisis that will hurt people for the sole purpose of advancing their ideological agenda,\" he adds. \"The American people have worked too hard to recover from crisis to see extremists in their Congress cause another one.\"\n\nRepresentative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, will use the Republican radio address on Saturday to shift the debate to another important deadline, Oct. 17, when Congress must raise the government's statutory borrowing limit or risk a potentially catastrophic default on the national debt.\n\nMore from The New York Times: U.S. and Iran Agree to Speed Talks Over Nuclear Dispute\n\nRace to the End for 'Breaking Bad' Binge-Viewers\n\nInKenya Attack, Narrow Escapes and Questions \"The president is now demanding that we increase the debt limit without engaging in any kind of bipartisan discussions about addressing our spending problem,\" Ms. Rodgers said. \"He wants to take the easy way out — exactly the kind of foolishness that got us here in the first place.\"\n\nCongressional Republicans are waging a two-front political war: one with Mr. Obama and the Democrats, the other within their own ranks.\n\nThe House Republicans' meeting, which is to begin at noon, is intended to produce spending legislation that is coupled with Republican health care demands, and the measure would face a vote on Sunday. That would leave the Senate just one day to deal with the House legislation before much of the government closes down for lack of funds. Without unanimous support in the Senate, the rules of the chamber would never let any such measure pass that quickly.\n\nwatch now",

         "Regional banks will dominate rest of earnings season this week. Here's what analysts expect",
         "Investors will parse through regional bank results this week to deliberate how to trade a sector that has been weighed down by the prospect of higher-for-longer interest rates. Regional bank stocks have slid in anticipation of their results this week, with the SPDR S & P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) sliding by more than 7% this month. A slew of results are on deck this week, such as from U.S. Bancorp and KeyCorp , among others. For investors, what's key this earnings season is the impact elevated interest rates may have on regional banks' net interest income, as well as commentary around exposure to commercial real estate after New York Community Bank's troubles this year. Net interest income is the difference between the revenue generated from loans and the interest paid on deposits. \"What we've seen is deposit pressures escalate more than previously anticipated,\" said Alexander Yokum, an analyst at CFRA Research, who has a neutral view on regional banks. \"A lot of these regional banks, they have less deposits, so if they lose deposits, it can really impact their operating results,\" Yokum said. \"So, higher for longer, I think for a lot of regional banks, would be negative.\" Thus far, reactions to results from the overall banking sector have been mixed. JPMorgan Chase shares dropped after the bank issued disappointing guidance on 2024 interest income, while Goldman Sachs shares climbed after the firm topped first-quarter estimates. M & T Bank shares rose this week post-earnings, while PNC shares on Tuesday dropped after its results. But some on Wall Street said they remain upbeat. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs' Ryan M. Nash said results are likely to be mixed, but that they \"should mark the bottom (or close to it for most).\" He continued, \"The move from 4-6 cuts down to 2-3 shouldn't have a meaningful impact on NII guides.\" Bank of America's Ebrahim H. Poonawala said this month he expects first-quarter earnings results to demonstrate resiliency, adding \"regional banks with strong deposit franchises should be well-suited to compete in a structurally higher rate backdrop.\" For investors, CFRA's Yokum maintained that it's important to remain a stock picker in the sector, adding they should choose firms that are well-capitalized with robust reserves. He also likes banks that are reducing their commercial real estate exposure. \"For banks, I think it's pretty important to be company-specific,\" Yokum said. \"I would really only pick the ones that you know, I feel like are strong from multiple categories.\" Here's what Wall Street analysts expect from regional banks this season. U.S. Bancorp U.S. Bancorp , which is set to report earnings on Wednesday, is rated as buy by a majority of analysts covering the stock, according to LSEG data. But some analysts worry about the setup for the stock going forward. \"USB's capital overhang has largely been alleviated with the Fed releasing USB from requirements to comply with Category II requirements by year-end 2024,\" Citi's Keith Horowitz wrote in an April note. \"However, we continue to see downside to consensus estimates and USB trades at a relative premium on our implied cost of equity metric as the stock is viewed as high-quality and defensive, so we see better risk/reward elsewhere.\" Horowitz has a neutral rating on U.S. Bank, as well as a price target of $45. The stock is down by more than 5% this year. Huntington Bancshares Huntington Bancshares is expected to release earnings on Friday. Shares of the Ohio-based firm have gained more than 2% this year, lagging the broader market. Analysts on average have a buy rating on the stock. Bank of America upgraded Huntington Bancshares to buy recently, saying the consensus view on Wall Street fails to appreciate the growth momentum in the bank. \"We view HBAN as well positioned to navigate multiple macro-economic outcomes,\" the firm's Poonawala wrote in an April note. \"Moreover, franchise investments and footprint should drive superior growth relative to most super-regional bank peers.\" KeyCorp, Comerica KeyCorp and Comerica are both set to report earnings this week. Shares of Comerica and KeyCorp are down this year by 10% and 1%, respectively. Additionally, Comerica has a hold rating, according to CNBC's analyst consensus tool. \"Considering that their long-term rates are rising again, these are two banks that we think could have a tough couple of quarters here,\" CFRA's Yokum said. \"They both do have pretty significant unrealized losses, and their net interest margins have gotten hit pretty hard.\" \"And they've seen pretty substantial non-interest bearing deposit outflows as well,\" Yokum added. Other regional banks reporting this week include Fifth Third Bancorp .",

         "Cramer: Tax reform and repatriation are not what stocks need to roar higher",
         "Virtually everyone on Wall Street assumes that President Trump's agenda for taxes and foreign assets must be passed in order for the stock market to roar higher this year, but Jim Cramer disagrees.\n\n\"The idea that we MUST have corporate tax reform and repatriation is something I no longer feel is as imperative as it once was,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\nThere was certainly no denying that Trump's championing of these issues and his endless parade of meetings with executives has helped the investing climate in the U.S. But that doesn't mean the stock market should throw away the necessity of growth and earnings as a dominant force.\n\n\"As long as we get worldwide growth like we are beginning to have, than in my view, we don't really need these two initiatives to propel this market,\" Cramer said.\n\nIn fact, the longer it takes Trump to pass these initiatives, the more investors can buy stocks with the notion that they will be there eventually.\n\nApparel maker PVH Corp, which has brands such as Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, has managed to make the numbers in retail while the competition has failed. Cramer attributed this to the strength of PVH's brands in Europe and Asia.\n\nApproximately 24 percent of PVH's $8 billion revenue stems from Europe, which is now subsidizing the 54 percent that is in the U.S.",

         "Brazil ETF (EWZ) popped 2%. Investors apparently believe the sell-off triggered by new taxes on foreign investments was overdone. - There was also chatter Brazil may back away from the tax, explains Tim Seymour.\n\nSt. Jude Medical (STJ) popped 3%. Although the company reported lower quarterly earnings, investors instead focused on the company’s higher sales as well as comments that suggested long- term goals remained intact.\n\nCree (CREE) popped 12%. The LED lighting manufacturer posted quarterly earnings and revenue well above Wall Street expectations and forecast strong results going forward.\n\nTupperware (TUP) popped 8%. The container maker reported better-than-expected earnings largely due to cost cuts and strength in emerging markets; they also raised full-year outlook.\n\nDROPS (stocks that slid lower)\n\nNorthern Trust (NTRS) dropped 6%. Although the firm swung to a profit in the third quarter the results fell short of analysts' expectations. - I think this stock goes lower, speculates Guy Adami.\n\nAltria (MO) dropped 3%.

         "Walgreens will be the first retailer in the U.S. to test an on-demand drone delivery service with Wing in Christiansburg, Virginia next month.\n\nAlphabet held a closed-door meeting with internal executives and external retailers last week to discuss potential investments and strategies in the logistics sector.\n\nThe event, which was held in Silicon Valley, was called the Alphabet Advanced Logistics Summit and hosted by Alphabet's research and development unit, \"X,\" and its recently spun out infrastructure company Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners, the company confirmed to CNBC. The objective was to explore potential business models and investment opportunities in the e-commerce space with a focus in logistics and fulfillment, according to three people who attended and photos viewed by CNBC.\n\n\"We frequently bring together stakeholders from across various industries to exchange ideas and brainstorm ways that technology can deliver innovative solutions in areas like logistics,\" a company spokesperson told CNBC in an emailed response.\n\nThe majority of attendees were from Alphabet, which had several teams present, according to the people, who asked for anonymity when discussing the confidential meeting. It also included representatives from external companies including FedEx , JD.com , Deliv, Flexe and a former Walmart SVP, said one of the people who attended.\n\nThe discussions come as the company tries to expand its digital shopping reach amid retail giants such as Amazon and Alibaba , both of which have invested significantly in retail, technology and logistics. Alphabet invested $550 million in China's second-largest online shopping service, JD.com, last year and began selling some of its goods in March.\n\nIt also comes a few months after Sidewalk Labs spun out a separate entity in August called Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners, which is still backed by Alphabet and Sidewalk Labs. SIP focuses on owning, acquiring and investing in technology-enabled infrastructure, particularly in urban areas. Sidewalk Labs is known for working on a high-profile and controversial new urban smart city on the waterfront of Toronto, for which it released the master plan in June. That plan also included an underground \"logistics hub.\"",

         "Members of the media examine Google's Pixel phone during an event to introduce Google hardware products on October 4, 2016 in San Francisco, California.\n\nShares of Google parent Alphabet jumped nearly 2 percent on Tuesday, after many outlets gave generally positive reviews for the company's upcoming smartphone, the \"Pixel.\"\n\nWith the pop, both Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares closed at all-time highs, at $821.49 and $795.26, respectively. The 1.82 percent rise for Class A shares marked their best day since July 29.\n\nThe reviews gave consumers and investors a peek at Google's first line of in-house designed smartphones, which made a splash when they were unveiled earlier this month at an event. With the largest Android maker, Samsung , still recuperating from problems with their Galaxy Note 7 catching fire, Google's Pixel could be a compelling competitor against Apple's iPhone 7 and an alternative for Android loyalists.\n\n\n\nWhile some reviewers were disappointed with the photo quality and battery life, many raved about the camera and artificial intelligence software installed on the smartphone.\n\nWalt Mossberg from The Verge boasted that \"the Pixel is easily the best Android phone I've ever tested.\"\n\nThe Pixel will be available for consumers in-store and shipped out by Thursday.\n\n— Anita Balakrishnan contributed to this report",

         "Private equity invaded sports in 2021 with nearly $2 billion in deals, and the NBA was in high demand",
         "Ballboys wear gloves while handling warmup basketballs as a precautionary measure prior to an NBA game between the Charlotte Hornets and Atlanta Hawks at State Farm Arena on March 9, 2020 in Atlanta, Georgia. Todd Kirkland | Getty Images\n\nU.S. stocks made a ton of money for investors in a decade-long bull market that lasted through the end of last year. But those returns pale in comparison to the windfall from sports investing, particularly in the National Basketball Association. The NBA has the highest price return compared to other leagues, as basketball's globalization has expanded to other markets, including its more than $5 billion China operation and the newly launched $1 billion NBA Africa venture. Between 2002 and 2021, the average price return for an NBA team was 1,057% compared to 458% returns on the S&P 500, according to estimates from PitchBook. But other sports offered solid returns, too. PitchBook estimates Major League Baseball clubs offered a 669% price return from 2002 to 2021, and the National Hockey League returned 467%. Now, private equity investors are rushing in for a piece of the action. PitchBook's 2021 private equity breakdown estimated over $1 trillion in total deals last year, and roughly $2 billion of that was spent purchasing equity stakes in U.S. sports franchises. Investors are attracted to \"the overall professionalization of sports,\" said Wylie Fernyhough, PitchBook's private equity lead analyst. \"It was certainly the beginning,\" Fernyhough said of PE sports deals in 2021. \"We're going to see a lot more deals going forward.\"\n\nNBA teams getting growth capital\n\nSports leagues including the NBA and Major League Soccer started allowing private equity to invest early in the pandemic. But Major League Baseball was the first league to eye private equity money. In a 2019 interview with CNBC, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred explained, \"Franchise values have escalated, the capital structures in the clubs have become more complicated. The idea of having a fund that would essentially be a passive equity investor in a club or clubs is one that is helpful in terms of facilitating sale transactions in clubs.\" Firms including Arctos Sports, Dyal Capital Partners, RedBird Capital and Sixth Street established funds to buy minority shares in teams in 2021, attracted to the economic moat around sports leagues, including the increasing value of media rights and global expansion. This is where the NBA is most attractive. Tennis, motorsports, and golf are considered the most global sports, but basketball is creeping up with its growth outside the U.S.\n\nBenjamin Chukwukelo Uzoh 2nd R of Rivers Hoopers of Nigeria vies with Wilson Nshobozwa of Patriots Rwanda during the opening game of the the inaugural Basketball Africa League BAL in Kigali, capital city of Rwanda, May 16, 2021. Cyril Ndegeya | Xinhua News Agency | Getty Images\n\nIn 2019, the NBA announced the Basketball Africa League, run by its NBA Africa entity. Friction remains from a 2019 dispute involving team executive Daryl Morey, but NBA China is still operating, and games are streaming on Tencent. The league is targeting India's massive population of more than one billion, too. In addition, the league's WNBA operation lured a $75 million raise last week that a source told CNBC's Kevin Stankiewicz values the league at $1 billion. The WNBA will use those funds to grow the women's game. Factoring in the established global footprint and \"younger fans on average,\" Fernyhough called buying minority stakes in NBA clubs a \"gigantic\" opportunity. \"I think there are a lot of reasons to be bullish on the NBA,\" he added. Chris Lencheski, chairman of private equity consulting company Phoenicia, agrees. \"The NBA has a clear, more straightforward, and well-defined path to a global consumer than just about every other major league that's stick and ball related,\" he said. \"And eventually,\" Lencheski added, \"within the next 20 years, you'll have supersonic travel, which will allow an NBA team to travel within three hours anywhere in the world. So, it's easy to see a Madrid versus the New York Knicks. And the NBA, by the nature of their product, is perfectly suited for that.\"\n\nGerry Cardinale, chief executive officer of Redbird Capital Partners LLC, stands for a photograph next to a 10-foot-tall statue of the Incredible Hulk in New York, U.S., on Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018. Griselda San Martin | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nInside the PE deals\n\nNBA teams, including the Golden State Warriors, Sacramento Kings, and San Antonio Spurs, sold stakes to private equity firms in 2021. Reports have Arctos taking a 13% stake in the Warriors, a franchise valued at $5.6 billion, according to Forbes. Using that valuation, Arctos' shares in the Warriors are worth more than $700 million. \"NBA teams are trading at more expensive valuation because they are expecting to grow more over the next decade or so,\" Fernyhough said. \"You just have to make sure it's done at the right price.\" PitchBook estimates Arctos raised roughly $3 billion to buy stakes in sports clubs, including NBA and NHL teams, as well as in the Fenway Sports Group, which owns the MLB Boston Red Sox and NHL Pittsburgh Penguins. Dyal, once a division of Neuberger Berman Group, took a minority stake in the Atlanta Hawks. RedBird, run by former Goldman Sachs executive Gerry Cardinale, made a splash with its $750 million investment in Fenway Sports Group. In addition, Ares Management Corporation invested $150 million in MLS franchise Inter Miami CF. Private firms make money on the funds by collecting management and incentive fees. Fernyhough estimates most of the stakes sold in NBA teams is for growth capital, allowing clubs to expand franchises, including upgrades to facilitates. The NBA doesn't allow private equity to own more than 30% in teams, with a maximum of 20% ownership for one fund. Fernyhough said there are no \"ownership accoutrements\" with PE stakes. Instead, those perks – like courtside seats – are reserved for limited partners like Michael Dell, who buys direct. MLS has similar rules to the NBA, with a minimum investment of $20 million. MLB doesn't have a set limit but evaluates investments on a deal-by-deal basis. There is a tax deduction known as \"roster depreciation allowance,\" allowing sports owners – even limited partners – to delay paying taxes on revenue earned from clubs. Former MLB commissioner Bud Selig mastered this tax loophole while owning a baseball team. \"We've seen these pro sports franchises go from something that was a trophy asset for rich guys to show off their wealth and be a part of an elite club to something that runs like a business,\" Fernyhough said.\n\nGeneral view at the start of the between the Atlanta Falcons v New York Jets, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, London, Britain - October 10, 2021. Matthew Childs | Action Images via Reuters\n\nWatch the Broncos to see if the NFL embraces PE\n\nWhile private equity has invaded the NBA, MLB, and NHL, the National Football League remains on the sidelines. The NFL is contemplating adding the capital safety nets, but it could take a while to figure out its plans. The NFL has more important concerns to address, including the Class Action complaint former Miami Dolphins coach Brian Flores filed last week. That lawsuit claims Dolphins owner Steven Ross offered Flores $100,000 to lose games – a violation of a federal law known as the \"sports bribery act.\" The forthcoming Denver Broncos sale will be telling. According to industry sources, the NFL could allow a private equity firm to get in on that transaction and obtain minority shares. Sports bankers estimate the Broncos sale could fetch $4 billion. That would be a record amount paid for a U.S. sports club, surpassing the $2.2 billion private equity tycoon David Tepper spent to buy the Carolina Panthers in 2018. Fernyhough said the league would likely approve an established fund if private equity is allowed in the NFL deal. \"The NFL is not likely going to let allow some new firm or group to come in and buy stakes of it,\" he said.\n\nwatch now",

         "Power has been restored to nearly 80 percent of utility customers in the New York City area who were blacked out by Super Storm Sandy, but a nor'easter looms that could set back efforts to return to normal.\n\nAs of late Sunday, Con Edison said approximately 180,000 customers were still without electricity, out of an estimated 950,000 affected. That includes 5,000 in Manhattan, 45,000 in Queens, 22,000 in Brooklyn, 16,000 in Staten Island and 10,000 in the Bronx.\n\nSome 2.2 million homes and businesses in New York lost power in the storm, which blew ashore in New Jersey a week ago.\n\nIn New Jersey, about 1 million homes and businesses remained without electricity Sunday, and many of those customers may not have service restored until Wednesday.\n\nBut as the region continued its struggle back to normalcy, the National Weather Service warned that a nor'easter with gusts of up to 55 mph was likely to reach the area by Wednesday. That could compound the havoc brought by last week's violent weather.\n\n\"Restoration crews love blue sky days,\" said John Miksad, Con Ed's senior vice president of electric operations. \"When the wind gets high and the weather gets ugly ... it just slows things down.\"\n\nQUOTE BOX BY SECTOR:",

If you have a local coffee shop for instance, it’s losing the battle to Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts and others.\"\n\nHenry added that although both the high- and low-end stores are drawing consumer demand, the middle segment “isn’t holding up that well right now.” He cited Gap as an example of a retailer that is attempting to attract the middle segment.\n\nWATCH: Insight on Black Friday with Barclays Capital\n\n______________________________\n\nCNBC Data Pages:\n\n______________________________\n\nDisclosures:\n\nDisclosure information was not available for David Henry or his company.\n\nDisclaimer",

         "Stocks making the biggest moves in the premarket: Twitter, Comcast, McDonald's, Tapestry & more",
         "Take a look at some of the biggest movers in the premarket:\n\nTwitter (TWTR) – Twitter reported quarterly profit of 11 cents per share, a penny a share above estimates. Revenue and the number of monetizable daily active users beating forecasts as well. Twitter is not giving any guidance for the current quarter or the full year due to uncertainty surrounding the current business environment.\n\nComcast (CMCSA) – The NBCUniversal and CNBC parent beat estimates by 3 cents a share, with quarterly profit of 71 cents per share. Revenue came in below Wall Street forecasts. The company added 477,000 high-speed internet customers during the quarter, the most in 12 years, while NBCUniversal and Sky experienced pressure during the quarter from the cancellations of sports events due to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nMcDonald's (MCD) – McDonald's fell 10 cents a share short of estimates, with profit of $1.47 per share. Revenue beat forecasts however. McDonald's had strong sales prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, but like many other restaurant chains it suffered a sizeable decline once the pandemic hit.\n\nDunkin' Brands (DNKN) – The restaurant chain beat estimates by 5 cents a share, with quarterly earnings of 67 cents per share. Revenue also topped estimates. Sales fell, however, as the coronavirus outbreak spread, with comparable sales down more than 19% in the final three weeks of the quarter. The company has now suspended its dividend and it withdrew its 2020 outlook.\n\nTapestry (TPR) – The company formerly known as Coach lost 27 cents per share for its latest quarter, wider than the 12 cents a share loss Wall Street was expecting. Revenue was above forecasts. Tapestry withdrew its full-year forecast after the coronavirus pandemic forced it to close stores, and the company has suspended dividends and share repurchases.\n\nKraft Heinz (KHC) – The food maker reported quarterly profit of 58 cents per share, 3 cents a share above estimates. Revenue also topped expectations. Organic sales rose 6.2%, as Kraft Heinz benefited from increased consumer demand related to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nCigna (CI) – The insurance company earned $4.69 per share for the first quarter, beating the consensus estimate of $4.35 a share. Revenue was above estimates as well. Cigna said it is meeting the challenges of the coronavirus outbreak and said it remains confident in the strength of its various business units.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) – Microsoft reported quarterly profit of $1.40 per share, 14 cents a share above estimates. Revenue also beat forecasts. Microsoft said the Covid-19 outbreak had minimal impact on revenue and it saw increased business in a number of its cloud-based segments.\n\nFacebook (FB) – Facebook fell 4 cents a share shy of estimates, with quarterly earnings of $1.71 per share. The social media giant's revenue exceeded Street projections. Facebook said that ad sales have stabilized in recent weeks, following a significant reduction in demand.\n\nTesla (TSLA) – Tesla posted an unexpected profit for the first quarter, with the automaker's revenue slightly above estimates despite shutdowns at its U.S. and China factories. Deliveries during the quarter came in slightly below estimates.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) – Qualcomm beat estimates by 10 cents a share, with quarterly profit of 88 cents per share. The chip maker's revenue beat consensus as well. Its current-quarter revenue forecast is in line with Street expectations, as the company signs more contracts for production of 5G phones which use more expensive chips.\n\nEBay (EBAY) – EBay reported quarterly earnings of 77 cents per share, 5 cents a share above estimates. The online marketplace operator's revenue topped estimates as well. The company said its marketplace business has been helped by worldwide shelter-in-place orders, and it gave stronger-than-expected guidance for full-year earnings and revenue.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) – ServiceNow earned $1.05 per share for its latest quarter, 10 cents a share above estimates. The enterprise cloud computing company's revenue was also above forecasts, however it anticipates the most significant challenges stemming from the coronavirus outbreak to occur during the second and third quarters.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) – Exxon Mobil maintained its quarterly dividend at 87 cents per share, at a time when many energy companies are cutting or eliminating their dividend. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) did just that this morning, slashing its dividend by two thirds after reporting a 46% drop in first-quarter profit. It was the company's first dividend cut since World War II.\n\nBoeing (BA) – The jet maker's debt rating was cut by rating agency Standard and Poor's to BBB-, one notch above junk status. The move stems from the expected impact of the coronavirus outbreak on Boeing's profits and cash flow over the next several years.\n\nAlign Technology (ALGN) – Align earned 73 cents per share for its latest quarter, well below the consensus estimate of $1.00 a share. The maker of Invisalign dental braces also saw revenue come in below forecasts. Align was impacted by the shutdown of most dental practices in mid-March, and withdrew 2020 guidance due to pandemic-related uncertainty.",

         "Amazon or Alphabet? Traders debate which is the better buy",
         "The \"Fast Money\" traders debated which stock is the better growth investment between Amazon and Alphabet .\n\nBoth companies posted strong earnings reports on Thursday. Amazon's adjusted earnings beat expectations by 67 cents, while Alphabet's beat by 38 cents.\n\nTrader Dan Nathan said that even though Amazon is pressuring traditional retailers, he sees most of the value of the company as being based on potential margin growth and speed of expansion of Amazon Web Services. Nathan said that what worries him is that Alphabet , IBM and Microsoft are all competing for market share in the same space.\n\nTrader Tim Seymour said that Alphabet still \"has a long way to go.\" He said that the company is more diversified than most people realize.\n\n\"It's not just YouTube. These guys have their entire web business. They have the entire search business. These are cash cows,\" Seymour said, adding that this is the better stock to own between Alphabet and Amazon because of its valuation.\n\nTrader David Seaburg agreed and said Alphabet is the better buy over Amazon on a near-term, relative value basis.\n\nTrader Steve Grasso said Facebook might be a better stock for investors looking for growth.",
